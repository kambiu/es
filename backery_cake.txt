Did you stay up \u2018til midnight this year? I had a really low-key Sunday to make up for a crazy New Year\u2019s Eve the night before. Since our party wasn\u2019t starting until ten, Emily and I offered to babysit the two sweetest children in the universe so their parents could go out for dinner. Normally, I don\u2019t like to babysit\u2013and I can count on one hand the number of times I\u2019ve done it since high school\u2014but these girls are a joy  to watch. It\u2019s like hanging out with friends, and they love to bake and taste-test for me! The last time I babysat, we made Fairy Dust Ice Cream . Saturday, sprinkles took center stage again: We \u201cpretend\u201d celebrated New Year\u2019s at 8 o\u2019clock. We blew paper horns, drank sparkling apple cider, and the girls ate their cupcakes: Single-Lady Funfetti Cupcake (makes just one cupcake) 3 tbsp flour (30g) (See directions for flour notes) heaping 1/16th tsp salt 1tbsp applesauce, oil, pre-melted vegan butter, or a combo (Try coconut oil. I also like 13g sbl.) 1tbsp plus 1 tsp liquid (milk of choice, or water) 1/4 tsp vanilla extract 1/4 tsp baking powder 2 tsp sprinkles (or more or less, as desired) Sweetener (Try 1\u00a0tbsp sugar or 1 packet stevia. If you use liquid sweetener, cut back on the other liquid.) Directions: Preheat the oven to 330 degrees. Mix the ingredients and pour into an oiled (or sprayed) muffin pan. Smooth top of batter. Cook for 12-15ish minutes. (Alternatively, you can cook this in a microwave.) See the following for Calories and Nutrition Facts . Notes on flour: I especially like the single-lady cupcakes with spelt flour. But you can use white flour, whole-wheat pastry, or even Arrowhead Mills gluten-free. (Also, if you\u2019ve never done fat-free baking: subbing all the oil in a recipe for applesauce will give you a gummier result. Still yummy, but much denser than your traditional cupcake with oil.) Questions of the Day: This New Year\u2019s Eve, did you\u2026 Stay up until midnight? Watch the ball drop in Times Square? Eat any lucky foods, such as lentils or greens? Or sprinkles. They\u2019re lucky, right? For more sprinkles: Here\u2019s a link to My Funfetti Recipes . I did end up making a dessert for the New Year\u2019s Eve party as well. That recipe will be tomorrow\u2019s post\u2026 Hope you like cookie dough! \ud83d\ude42 No ratings yet.

I actually made cupcakes for the first time ever for new year\u2019s eve this year! chocolate covered strawberry ones. No \u201clucky\u201d foods were consumed yesterday, just a delicious mushroom sausage risotto my mom made \ud83d\ude42 Happy New Year! Reply Brittany @ Itty Bits of Balance says 2nd January 2012 at 3:15 pm I love the idea of this, Katie! I made homemade funfetti cookies a few months back, but they were not quite as healthy as this beauty at all haha Reply Maria @ Beautiful Busy Bee says 2nd January 2012 at 3:15 pm On NYE we stayed uplate watching the Tree of Life, which was actually a very boring movie and we ended up fast forwarding through 30 mins of it, during which there were just natural shots of how life evolved on Earth (like dinosaurs and stuff). We had black bean and peach salsa, and I guess the beans are lucky. \ud83d\ude42 Happy New Year\u2019s! Reply Erin says 2nd January 2012 at 3:15 pm I always eat black eyed peas, greens, and corn bread on NYE. This year I made them all animal product free and they were fantastic. I also made your chocolate chip cookie dough dip (but ended up making them into actual cookies based on your recipe). Reply Alexandra (Veggin' Out in the Kitchen) says 2nd January 2012 at 3:29 pm Funfetti cupcake???  Yes, please \ud83d\ude42  I\u2019m definitely going to have to try this sometime!  I love anything that includes sprinkles (or chocolate \u2013 maybe I could add some cocoa powder and/or chocolate chips for a chocolate funfetti cupcake!).  I\u2019m so glad that you had a good New Year, Katie! \ud83d\ude00 Reply Katie @ Peace Love & Oats says 2nd January 2012 at 3:44 pm I did stay up until midnight and I had blacked eyes peas, pork and greens! Reply Megan says 2nd January 2012 at 3:51 pm I love your cupcakes! I have those sprinkles too. I am glad you had an enjoyable New Year and happy 2012! I did stay up until midnight, drank champagne, had lentils the night before (does that count?), and surprisingly, did not have to bake anything for a NYE party. I am excited about tomorrow\u2019s cookie dough! Reply Amanda says 2nd January 2012 at 4:10 pm I think the Monday after a holiday break calls for a cupcake. \ud83d\ude42 I love the built-in portion control in your recipe! Reply Sarah @ See Sarah Back says 2nd January 2012 at 4:16 pm Too adorable.  What did you use for the frosting? Reply Chocolate-Covered Katie says 3rd January 2012 at 12:47 am The girls squirted on something they had in the house from a can. Ok, not healthy\u2026 but they had a ton of fun squirting it! Reply Julie H. of Spinach and Sprinkles says 2nd January 2012 at 4:22 pm What fun!!!! Babysitting kids like that does sound like a good time! \ud83d\ude42 Especially with cupcakes and SPRINKLES!! \ud83d\ude42 Reply Nicole @ Giraffelegs says 2nd January 2012 at 4:28 pm awww super cute! Reply Amanda says 2nd January 2012 at 4:35 pm I love funfetti cupcakes!!!! They are my absolute favorite-I will definitely be making one of these soon! One question: if you bake it the microwave, how long should it bake for? Thanks for sharing! Reply Chocolate-Covered Katie says 3rd January 2012 at 1:00 am It depends on your microwave power. Mine would take about a minute, but I know some other people have to microwave it for two or more. Reply Ashley @ Southern Purple Vegan says 2nd January 2012 at 5:03 pm I have veganized hoppin john with kale and cornbread for my lucky foods. Reply Julie Camacho says 2nd January 2012 at 5:50 pm To make a whole cake, would I multiply by 24? Reply Chocolate-Covered Katie says 3rd January 2012 at 1:01 am Sorry, I\u2019m not sure :-?. Reply Anna @ The Guiltless Life says 2nd January 2012 at 5:58 pm Growing up my absolute FAVOURITE cake mix was funfetti. I would go nuts for the stuff. Of course it was just loaded with sugar. It\u2019s so fun to think if I have kids I can still replicate that experience for them with this recipe (my kids would NOT be eating sugary cake mixes lol!). Thank you for that! I went to a Cirque du Soleil themed gala on New Year\u2019s Eve \u2013 it was so much fun and throughout the night circus performers would do performances, like incredible balancing acts, contortionists, stilt-walkers and jugglers. It was awesome! Reply Jennyb says 2nd January 2012 at 6:03 pm i need to get me some sprinkles! \ud83d\ude42 Reply Aja says 2nd January 2012 at 6:10 pm Cute. I need to go buy some sprinkles now! Reply Erin @ Dinners, Dishes, and Desserts says 2nd January 2012 at 6:25 pm I LOVE this cupcake!  Wish I had seen it yesterday.  My birthday is the 1st, and not wanting more dessert around we skipped cake \ud83d\ude41  This would have been perfect! Reply Rebecca @ Naturally Healthy and Gorgeous says 2nd January 2012 at 6:58 pm Funfetti is my favorite flavor! \ud83d\ude42 Reply Leigh says 2nd January 2012 at 8:03 pm Beautiful, festive cupcake! I\u2019m thinking a Chinese New Year edition is going to find it\u2019s way into my ovens at home! \ud83d\ude09 Thanks for posting the recipe!! Happy New Year!

I just said peanut butter optional. #wordsineverthoughtiwouldsay} Hi everyone! You may not know it but I\u2019ve been kiiiiind of ignoring this space for the last two weeks. All my posts through yesterday were scheduled before Christmas. I wish I could say I\u2019ve just been relaxing on the couch for the past two weeks, soaking up books and movies, but alas. I\u2019ve been arm deep in batter and cheesecake and cookies. Such is life\u2026for another month or so. It\u2019ll be worth it in the end. Anyway. the other day I asked on Facebook\u00a0 \u00a0if I should post a mug cookie or a regular cookie recipe today. And overwhelmingly the answer was MUG! And I\u2019m super glad too, because the cookie recipe is fabulous (coming later this week) but this mug cookie is WOW. It\u2019s a cookie. For one. In a mug. It\u2019s a chocolate cookie. With mini chocolate chips. And peanut butter. In a mug. Single-serve. For one. If you\u2019re not like me and don\u2019t have two identical (but for the failed crust on one) cheesecake bars, a batch of donuts, and three dozen cookies on their counter, and you want something sweet but not a whole batch , this recipe is for you. I adapted an adaption of this chocolate cookie recipe  to make this cookie. This is where my nerdy math background (summa cum laude in mathematics, thankyouverymuch, although I laugh when I think about it because I\u2019m so not even close to that level anymore, if I even was) comes in handy. I can convert fractions of cups into tablespoons and teaspoons and divide by 12 or 36 or whatever. It\u2019s actually quite simple\u2026which I know just made about 3/4 of you roll your eyes. The tricky part is the egg. How do you twelfth an egg? You don\u2019t. You adjust other things so that you can use 1 yolk. It\u2019s just how it is. The beauty of this recipe is that you can make it egg-free  by substituting milk or water (1 tablespoon) for the egg yolk. It won\u2019t rise as much or be as rich, but it\u2019ll still be good. The chocolate and richness of this cookie make it taste like a brownie. A rich fudgy brownie that\u2019s actually a cookie that\u2019s been 36th\u2019d. The peanut butter is just because I\u2019m\u2026me. Everything is better with peanut butter, especially chocolate and fudgy cookies. I just added a dollop of Super Chunk Skippy  Naturals (my favorite brand). You can totally leave it off, or use Nutella or Biscoff or any other nut butter or spread. It whisks up in a few minutes and cooks in 30 seconds. Perfect when you need chocolate NOW but got rid of it all because it\u2019s January. It\u2019s almost too easy. I\u2019m sorry? Print Recipe Did you make this recipe? Leave a review \u00bb Double Chocolate Peanut Butter Mug Cookie Ingredients: 1 tablespoon butter (you can substitute butter spread) 1 tablespoon brown sugar 1 teaspoon granulated sugar 3 drops pure vanilla extract 1/8 teaspoon baking powder 1 egg yolk (or 1 tablespoon water or milk, but it's won't be as high or as rich) 2 teaspoons cocoa powder 1 tablespoon flour 1 tablespoon mini chocolate chips 1 tablespoon peanut butter (creamy or chunky), optional (also try Nutella, Biscoff, or any other spread) Directions: Place butter in an 8-ounce coffee mug (or bigger, but it doesn\u2019t grow much). Melt in the microwave, about 20 seconds. Stir in sugars, vanilla, and baking powder. Stir in egg yolk, coca, and flour. Stir in chocolate chips. Place peanut butter in the center and press it down slightly into the batter. Heat in the microwave for 30 seconds. Let cool slightly before eating. All images and text \u00a9 Dorothy Kern for  .

Whenever my mixture has been too thin it just boils over! \u2014 Lynn @ The Actor's Diet January 6, 2014 @ 5:43 pm Reply DUDE. I just bought a jar of Skippy Natural! How excited am I? \u2014 Dorothy Kern January 6, 2014 @ 7:42 pm Reply Be very. I love that PB!!! \ud83d\ude42 \u2014 Amy January 6, 2014 @ 5:54 pm Reply I totally laughed about the recipe math part\u2026 I do that ALL the time! (And it totally helps confused customers on the baking aisles who need to know how many teaspoons are in a tablespoon and how many tablespoons are in a cup.) I ran into the problem of dividing eggs a few years ago when trying to halve a cake recipe with 3 eggs. I started using an egg substitute called Ener-G (very popular in vegan baking!). It\u2019s a shelf-stable powder (lasts for months, if not years!), and 1 1/2 tsp Ener-G + 2 tbsp warm water = 1 egg. Much easier to divide that kind of egg by 12! \ud83d\ude09 \u2014 Dorothy Kern January 6, 2014 @ 7:42 pm Reply Sweet! I need to find that. I thought about using my husbands egg whites, but figured not everyone would have it on hand. Thanks Amy! \u2014 Amy January 6, 2014 @ 10:56 pm You\u2019re welcome! Some Safeways have it; others don\u2019t. But I can always find it at Whole Foods and the Nugget (not sure if that chain extends past Sacramento though!). Any vegetarian- or vegan- or health-food oriented store should carry it. Good luck!! \ud83d\ude42 Mom             \t \u2014 January 6, 2014 @ 6:49 pm Reply OMG! Great idea for whenever I run out of chocolate\u2026.Yeah right!! \ud83d\ude42 \u2014 Dorothy Kern January 6, 2014 @ 7:40 pm Reply Well not you, obviously.

The cookie truly looks like a brownie (you just stole my heart) and I can\u2019t stop thinking about that warm melted peanut butter in the middle.  After my microwave failures, this recipe has all of my respect! \u2014 Dorothy Kern January 7, 2014 @ 6:34 am Reply Thanks Mary Frances! The egg yolk does it. \ud83d\ude42 Plus all the chocolate.

SO, I cut out some of the brown sugar and used applesauce instead of the egg.  It was still pretty good. Not very sweet, but didn\u2019t need to be, it was rich enough.

I made this mug cake because of 2 reasons last night: 1) I had a dream about it (because I follow your blog) and I had made it in my dreams. So of course it\u2019s in my subconscious I had to give it a try.  Lol 2) Last night I went to a dinner party and for dessert there was a yucky custard-y-pudding-trifle. Ewww I mean that\u2019s just yuck! When I came home I made this mug cookie and I\u2019m so glad I did, it was the perfect size and it was really good. I\u2019m gonna try the coffee cake one too that you posted earlier. thanks \u2014 Dorothy Kern January 9, 2014 @ 8:13 pm Reply I\u2019m glad you liked it!!

I think it totally could. I\u2019m not sure what them measurements are, but I\u2019d say 1/2 an egg (however much egg beaters that is). Whites would work too.

But I have to share something with those of you who have a Whole Foods Market nearby. If you are a PB lover, you MUST TRY the fresh ground honey peanut butter, usually available in their bulk section. I always grind it fresh in the store, although they also have it ready to go as well. It\u2019s something psychological, I guess. haha. I assure you\u2026 It.Is.The.Best.EVER! \u2014 Dorothy Kern March 22, 2014 @ 2:16 pm Reply I LOVE their freshly ground PB! And, if you have a food processor, you can make your own too.

It\u2019s so chocolaty (I added an extra Tablespoon mini-chocolate chips). I have tried other mug recipes but always felt they were much too large. This is the perfect serving! My only complaint is that is a little dry. Next time, I will use 1 whole egg instead of just the yolk. Also, I stirred the peanut butter in. Thank you for satisfying my late night chocolate craving!

For birthdays my kids LOVE giant cookie cakes or skillet brownies. \u00a0I will on occasion make cupcakes  at Stella\u2019s request, but even that doesn\u2019t happen very often. My cake pans pretty much just collect dust in the back of my cupboards. But, Easter is nearly here, and in case you have not noticed, carrot cake is everywhere. Carrot cake is one cake that I absolutely LOVE. \u00a0Unfortunately, it\u2019s the one cake my family will not eat. At all. If I make a carrot cake, I\u2019d have to eat the whole thing by myself. Which may not be a bad thing except that the weather is changing, and I can no long er hide under my comfy sweater. At least not without sweating profusely. So what\u2019s a girl to do when she wants carrot cake? really Make it single serving, and healthier, that\u2019s what, and it\u2019s ready in less than 5 minutes, so I can have it whenever  I want.

Weeee! Since we celebrate with sweets over here, this is a Single Serving Chocolate Chip Cupcake just for you \u2013 because sometimes all you need is 1 cupcake \u2013 not 12. And let\u2019s be real, spring break is like, right around the corner. While I would love to eat 12 of these cutie cupcakes, I should probably stick to one.. I\u2019m also trying something new in January! I\u2019m going oil-free for the month with Lindsay from The Planted Palate .\u00a0We decided to team up so we can help each other out. Please join us! I\u2019ll be sharing oil-free yumminess for the entire month. I\u2019m not saying I will go oil-free forever but I want to give it a shot and see if I honestly miss it or if it\u2019s all in my head. There\u2019s no such thing as \u201chealthy oils\u201d and I want to challenge myself to come up with oil-free recipes that are mouthwatering, enticing and plant based. Check out this post  to read more about oils, what to replace them with and why cutting back on them is beneficial for your health. So this cupcake is vegan, gluten-free, nut-free, oil-free and for the hippies. Just kidding! (about the hippies part) It\u2019s actually the yummiest and most adorable cupcake I\u2019ve ever made. Plus you can\u2019t go wrong with coconut cream frosting. So who wants to join us and go oil-free in January?! I\u2019ve significantly cut back on cooking with oil the past couple months and I\u2019m finding it totally unnecessary. I used to think cooking with oil was for flavor \u2013 that is so not the case! You will not miss all those empty calories \u2013 especially in this cupcake. Instead of oil, I used applesauce which I do quite often in baking. I hope you enjoy! Chocolate Chip Cupcake For One 2015-01-02 14:03:27 Serves 1 Write a review Save Recipe Print Prep Time 5 min Cook Time 15 min Total Time 20 min Prep Time 5 min Cook Time 15 min Total Time 20 min Ingredients 3 tablespoons gluten-free all-purpose flour (buckwheat, millet, etc. I also used spelt flour) 1 tablespoon coconut sugar (or raw cane sugar) 1/4 teaspoon baking powder tiny pinch of fine grain sea salt 1 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon unsweetened almond milk 1 tablespoon applesauce 1/2 tablespoon dairy-free chocolate chips (like the Enjoy Life brand) Coconut Cream Frosting 2 tablespoons coconut cream (*1 can full-fat coconut milk, refrigerated overnight) 1/4 teaspoon coconut sugar Instructions Preheat oven to 330 degrees F. Line a cupcake tin with one cupcake liner. In a small bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Mix well. Add in the almond milk, applesauce and chocolate chips. Mix until well combined. Pour mixture into the cupcake liner and bake for 14-15 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. To make Coconut Cream Open a can of full-fat coconut milk that has been refrigerated overnight.

I don\u2019t know what went wrong for me, but the mixture was just crumbs\u2026 and the finished product was dust. I used coconut flour, and I didn\u2019t have any applesauce, so I used an egg (for two cupcakes\u2019 worth). I\u2019m sure I measured everything right, but there just wasn\u2019t enough liquid. Reply Melissa says 10/19/2015 at 11:57 AM It was so good! I did use stevia instead of sugar, but it was really yummy! It was like eating an apple flapjack withouth the greasy puffpastry. Thanks for the recipe! Reply Emily Joyce says 08/05/2015 at 4:50 AM Hello! What a lovely recipe! Do you think that oat flour would work well? Reply Kate says 06/08/2015 at 2:06 PM There are many healthy oils. They may be high calorie, but they are healthy. Reply Christi says 01/09/2015 at 12:20 PM Having a hard time with the coconut cream \u2013 I can never get it to thicken\u2026 am I doing something wrong? Should I try a different type of coconut milk? Reply Shannon Leparski says 01/09/2015 at 1:48 PM Hey Christi! Make sure it\u2019s full-fat canned coconut milk. I use the Thai Kitchen brand because the generic brands have never worked for me! Refrigerate it overnight and when you remove the can from the fridge, gently open it without shaking it or stirring it up. The cream should separate from the watery milky mixture in the bottom. I hope that works! Let me know. xx, Shannon Reply Danielle Weiss says 01/07/2015 at 3:37 PM hello- i would love to make this recipe but for a whole tray of cupcakes, since its a great recipe without oil. How would i do that? Reply Shannon Leparski says 01/09/2015 at 1:56 PM Hi Danielle, I\u2019m thinking about doing this recipe for 12 cupcakes but it will take some experimenting and calculations as I haven\u2019t tried it before. There are recipe measurement calculators online if you want to experiment and calculate it out! Reply Natalie @ Feasting on Fruit says 01/03/2015 at 7:51 AM This is too darn cute! I totally love the single serving size, because it\u2019s just me and my dog around here and we definitely don\u2019t need 12. I\u2019m totally with you, oil-free January sounds like an awesome idea!! I already try not to use oil as much as possible, but this will keep me accountable \ud83d\ude09 Reply Shannon Leparski says 01/04/2015 at 11:23 AM Haha yea sometimes all you want is one little cupcake without anymore temptations! I\u2019m happy you want to join in on the oil free january fun \ud83d\ude42 Thanks Natalie! Reply Sue Johnston says 01/02/2015 at 8:44 PM You state that the cupcake is gluten-free, but it has spelt flour?  I didn\u2019t think that spelt was gluten-free?  It sure looks good though! Reply Shannon Leparski says 01/02/2015 at 9:05 PM Hi Sue \u2013 you are correct! My mistake, I did try it with buckwheat flour and it worked just fine so any gluten free flour you have on hand would work well! Thank you for pointing that out! Reply Carey says 01/02/2015 at 6:40 PM Hi! I am very much looking forward to your oil-free recipes this month! I have learned a lot about oil-free cooking  in the past couple years after following bloggers like Happy Herbivore and Vegan 8! I never saute veggies in oil anymore \u2013 I always use vegetable broth/stock and I think it tastes just as good! The only thing I\u2019ve found that I\u2019ve missed oil on is popcorn \u2013 the seasonings don\u2019t really stick to it without the oil so you\u2019re basically eating it dry and I still use a little cooking spray on my casserole dishes and bake-ware so the food doesn\u2019t stick. Reply Shannon Leparski says 01/02/2015 at 9:12 PM Hi Carey \u2013 That\u2019s awesome! I\u2019ve been using broth instead too! I never thought about popcorn.. hmm I will miss oil on popcorn! Guess I will have to stay away from casserole type recipes too, at least for this month. I don\u2019t plan on being super strict and going oil-free forever but I want to try it out and know that oil isn\u2019t required. Can\u2019t wait to share and thank you for following along! Reply Vanessa @ VeganFamilyRecipes.com says 01/02/2015 at 4:49 PM Congrats on your 100th post! Love how to chocolate chip cupcake serves one. I might just double err\u2026 dodeca (yes, look it up!) this recipe! I\u2019m sorry but I can\u2019t go oil-free\u2026.I\u2019m not that brave yet\u2026maybe next January \ud83d\ude42 Reply Shannon Leparski says 01/02/2015 at 5:21 PM Thank you Vanessa! I don\u2019t blame you \u2013 it\u2019s a little crazy.. but I honestly don\u2019t think it will be as hard as it seems. We shall see!!

Does this look familiar ? From the photo, we appear  to have something I\u2019ve blogged about before \u2013 Farm-Fresh Strawberry Shortcakes with Amaretto-Spiked Whipped Cream  ( click for recipe ). It looks like a rich shortcake with sugar-sweetened strawberries and fluffy, potentially-spiked, whipped cream, right? As it turns out, looks can definitely be deceiving\u2026 Mini Breakfast Strawberry Shortcake for One Recipe What we actually have here is a strawberry shortcake made-over for breakfast. For this Mini Breakfast Strawberry Shortcake for One Recipe, I added one of my favorite breakfast ingredients \u2013 oats. I also used a whole grain flour (spelt), cut the sugar by not macerating the strawberries in sugar, and found a fabulous, breakfast-worthy substitute for the whipped cream \u2013 yogurt. I\u2019m not going to promise you that this is healthy, but it is more breakfast-friendly. Would a chocolate croissant have more butter and sugar? I don\u2019t really know, and I don\u2019t really care. But, anywho, you could probably use this version as another Not So Sweet  dessert with even less sugar than the original . Just tell them it\u2019s good for you because of the probiotics. Yeaaaaaa\u2026 Breakfast Strawberry Shortcake for One {Recipe} Print Prep time 5 mins Cook time 15 mins Total time 20 mins Breakfast Strawberry Shortcake for One I took my dessert strawberry shortcake recipe and switched up the ingredients to make it more breakfast-friendly. I used a whole grain flour, added oats, skipped macerating the strawberries, and substituted yogurt for the whipped cream. You could probably make this even healthier by substituting a good oil (maybe coconut?) for the butter (and please report back if you do). Oh, and I took almost all of the sugar out of this baby, so if you like your breakfast sweeter, by all means, add your preferred sweetener, to taste. *Vegetarian, Vegan Options Listed* Author: Diana of thechiclife.com Serves: 1 Ingredients \u00bc cup spelt flour (or flour of choice) 2 tablespoons oats 2 teaspoons sugar \u00bc teaspoon baking powder \u215b teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon butter, cold (or sub vegan substitute, like Earth Balance) 3 tablespoons milk (or vegan non-dairy milk) 3-4 strawberries, tops removed, sliced 1 small container vanilla, Greek yogurt (or yogurt of choice or vegan yogurt, like a coconut-milk-based option) - or sub plain yogurt and add sweetener of choice, to taste Instructions Pre-heat oven to 400 degrees F. Prepare a small baking sheet with parchment paper. Combine flour, oats, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a medium-sized bowl. Whisk (or use a fork) to evenly combine. Use a pastry cutter or fork to cut butter into the dry ingredients until the butter is in small bits (about the size of rice grains or pop rocks...yea, I said pop rocks). Gently stir in the milk/non-dairy milk until just combined (careful to not over-mix, but do ensure all flour combined into dough). Form dough into a ball-shape and place on the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 15-18 minutes, until golden brown on top and cooked through (if a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean). Allow to cool to room temperature. Cut shortcake in half. Top bottom half of shortcake with strawberries. Stir yogurt to desired texture and spoon as much as you'd like (I used about half the container) over the strawberries. Top yogurt with top half of shortcake and enjoy. 3.4.3177 More Delicious Baked Recipes Farm-Fresh Strawberry Shortcakes with Amaretto-Spiked Whipped Cream Green Monster Muffins  (or click here for the vegan version ) Individual Peach Blueberry Breakfast Crisp Dessert for breakfast?

Reply Kiki says April 27, 2015 at 9:16 pm just tried this and it was so delicious and love that it\u2019s not too awful for you.  I did have a quick question: what is the dough consistency supposed to be like?  Mine was goopy so I added in some more flour and it was still not a \u201cdough\u201d. And then I baked it for 20 minutes and it wasn\u2019t close to a golden brown and the inside was still doughy. Help please!

I\u2019ve figured out how to do portion control for sweets. I\u2019m hesitant to share, but I think it\u2019s important so here goes. The secret\u2026 to perfect portion control\u2026 is\u2026 To make it a pain in the ass to make another one. Confused?\u00a0 Let me explain. When it comes to coffee cake, specifically the kind with a lovely streusel topping, I have almost zero self control.\u00a0 It\u2019s just so stinking delicious and I think that deep down I just really want to eat the entire thing in one sitting, so I do and then blame it on the streusel.\u00a0 Or the fact that I did 100 lunges uphill  yesterday on our walk and can now no longer feel my legs.\u00a0 Yeah, that wasn\u2019t a smart move. Oops. But I discovered the other day that if I make one tiny little cake that it just becomes too much for me to actually make two of them, so I eat the one and only wish for a second rather than eating it.\u00a0 It\u2019s genius!\u00a0 Not to mention completely and totally delicious and completely and totally worth it to double, triple, or quadruple the recipe and eat it all on the spot  save some for later.\u00a0 So I guess I should say:\u00a0 forget what I said earlier about this being a pain to make.\u00a0 That\u2019s just me whining on account of my legs, but it\u2019s nothing a little coffee cake can\u2019t cure. CINNAMON STREUSEL COFFEE CAKE FOR ONE (IN A JAR) For the cake: 2 Tbsp sugar 2 Tbsp plain yogurt 1 egg white 2 1/2 Tbsp flour 1/8 tsp baking powder 1/8 tsp salt 1/4 tsp vanilla For the streusel: 2 Tbsp butter, cut into small cubes 2 Tbsp brown sugar 1 Tbsp flour 1/2 tsp cinnamon Preheat your oven to 350 and spray the inside of an 8 oz. wide-mouth mason jar with nonstick spray (if you don\u2019t have a jar you can certainly use an oven-safe ramekin, but make sure you want it as it will likely bake faster).\u00a0 Whisk together the sugar, yogurt egg white and vanilla until smooth.\u00a0 Fold in the flour, baking powder and salt until everything is combined.\u00a0 For the streusel mix together the cubed butter pieces, brown sugar, cinnamon and flour and using your fingers work the butter into the dry ingredients until a fine crumb forms.\u00a0 Pour half of the batter into the bottom of the jar, top with 1/3 of the streusel mixture, top with the remaining batter and then top the entire thing off with the remaining streusel mixture.\u00a0 Place on a baking sheet lined with foil and bake at 350 for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean.\u00a0 Let cool before eating, and be careful\u2026the jar will be hot!\u00a0 I topped mine with a little cream cheese frosting  that I melted slightly.

I didn\u2019t add coffee to the cake if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking; rather it\u2019s made to be enjoyed with  a cup of coffee! Reply Becky Godoy says October 20, 2015 at 9:48 am This is an awesome portion size recipe.  I think this would be great mass produced for get togethers.  Then I don\u2019t have to do anything but serve.  Can\u2019t wait to try. Reply Jan McFalls says October 4, 2015 at 12:53 pm This has to be the most tempting recipe I have viewed in sometime. Going to get my mason jar and get to work! Thanks! Reply Tia says July 28, 2015 at 8:16 am Tasted great but can\u2019t say much for the texture of the cake or the streusel. I didn\u2019t mind though\u2026 great for a little quick snack! P.S. \u2013 I would suggest cutting into the cold cubed butter and mixing it using a pair of butter knives instead of your fingers because that seemed to make my butter soft! Reply Heather says July 28, 2015 at 3:01 pm Thanks so much for the update Tia \u2013 I\u2019m always happy to hear how I can make recipes better!

I did substitute the egg white for white tablespoon of oil.  Next time I would half the butter in the streusel as it just melted in the microwave.

Reply miriam says June 5, 2013 at 9:40 am I would thoroughly enjoy looking through your site, but almost the first thing I see is an ugly word. I don\u2019t use profanity, don\u2019t allow my children to use it and I certainly don\u2019t have to view it on the computer.  So I won\u2019t be back.  Have a nice day. Reply Heather says June 5, 2013 at 10:54 am Hi Miriam, You are certainly entitled to your opinion, and I am sorry if my choice of words offended you. My tone that day is not necessarily indicative of me as a person or my blog in general, so I hope you can give it another chance! Have a wonderful day, Heather Reply Susie says April 17, 2013 at 7:28 am These are cute,but question: I just read on a different site about baking in jars.They said you should bake in a water bath. You didn t have a problem not? Reply Heather says April 17, 2013 at 9:00 am Hey Susie!  I did not have a problem with mine not being in a water bath; I *think* it depends on what you\u2019re baking, but just a regular oven worked fine for me.  I did place my jar on a baking sheet though, rather than just on the wire rack. Reply Megan says December 4, 2012 at 9:37 pm I adore this recipe and the idea so much that I would love to make a ton of these and give them to people for the holidays!  I was just curious if I could make this recipe in a regular sized 8 oz mason jar, just because the ones pictured are quite expensive if you want to buy a ton of them!  Thank you so much, and thanks for posting this recipe! Reply Heather says December 5, 2012 at 8:37 am Hey Megan! I\u2019m sure that it would work just fine with the slimmer 8 oz jars, although you\u2019d probably have to adjust the baking time a little.  I think  you might have to decrease the temperature a bit and then increase the cooking time!  Maybe try doing just one to test first?  Let me know how it works!

Look how pretty it is! I don\u2019t usually ever have an entire cheesecake in the house and I rarely make it. My brothers and Mr. K used to always ask for it and then it was like pulling teeth to get them to finish it once I did. And I can never eat more than one slice. MY LATEST VIDEOS That is why this one serving treat is so perfect. The texture isn\u2019t exact. It\u2019s close, but the microwave version doesn\u2019t come out as creamy as the baked version. I tried a few attempts but haven\u2019t gotten it to be exactly like the baked version yet. I\u2019ll keep trying. But it tastes like cheesecake and it was delicious. The one thing is, just like a regular baked cheesecake, you need to let this cool. I\u2019m so used to eating a mug cake right after it comes out of the microwave, but this is cheese and when cheese is warm, well, it doesn\u2019t really taste like cheesecake. It tastes like warm, sweetened cheese, and it\u2019s a little oily. So definitely give this time to cool in the fridge. I let mine cool for an hour. You can check out my entire mug cake recipe collection . here Hot Off the Press! This recipe, along with many brand new  recipes are in my new cookbook . Microwave Cheesecake Mug Cake Print Recipe Ingredients: for the cheesecake: 4 tbsp light cream cheese (you can also use cream cheese spread which actually is much easier to mix, though the final cake has looser layers) 2 tbsp plain Greek yogurt (or sour cream) 2 1/2 tbsp granulated sugar (less if you are using a sweetened flavored cheese spread) 1 egg 1/4 tsp vanilla for the crust: 4 tbsp graham cracker crumbs (place through food processor to get fine crumbs. 4 tbsp is about 1 sheet of graham cracker) 1 tbsp melted butter Directions: 1. Grease the inside of a microwave-safe mug (both interior sides and bottom). Add graham cracker crumbs and melted butter and mix until butter is incorporated. Press down with your hands so the graham cracker crumbs form a crust at bottom of mug. 2. In a small bowl, whisk egg. Then add cream cheese, yogurt, sugar and vanilla. Using a small whisk, mix until batter is smooth. If you are using cream cheese and not spread, there may remain lumps of cream cheese. If that is the case, use a bigger whisk, which should help you break up all the lumps. Pour batter into mug. 3. Cover top of mug with a paper towel or napkin and microwave for 1 minute. Mug cake should be mostly cooked except center. Pause to check on it, then microwave for another 20 seconds. Stop again, and microwave for another 20 seconds. Then microwave for one final round of 20 seconds. Cake should be completely cooked. You don't want to microwave the entire amount at once because the batter may overheat and start popping and exploding in the microwave. 4. If you have greased your mug, the cheesecake should have pulled away from the sides of the mug. Gently slide cheesecake out of the mug. I let it come out upside down onto a big spatula and then flipped it back over onto a plate. Let cool cake at room temperature for a few minutes. When cake is no longer too hot to touch, place in fridge to cool and set for at least 1 hour. All images and content are \u00a9 Kirbie's Cravings. Did you make this recipe?

Kirbie             \t \u2014 October 31, 2013 @ 11:22 am Reply I agree that would make it easier to flip out. I\u2019m not sure how well it will cook though with the crust on top and also the crust might not become firm enough if it\u2019s not weighted during the cooking process. It\u2019s actually pretty easy to flip over if you bake it with the crust on the bottom because the cake slides out really easily. \u2014 leanne October 31, 2013 @ 8:47 am Reply Single serving cheesecake (that doesn\u2019t take hours to bake) sounds perfect!

It worked out perfectly for me. I just did it a little differently: I only baked the filling and crumbled a few graham cracker pieces in top after baking.

Kirbie             \t \u2014 January 21, 2014 @ 12:27 pm Reply are you using greek yogurt? it has to be greek and not regular because the regular yogurt\u2019s consistency is too thin. also some brands of greek yogurt are also watery. sour cream is the best option but a thick greek yogurt should work too Cait             \t \u2014 February 9, 2014 @ 5:56 pm Reply I tried this recipe and loved it. I\u2019ve made it 2 times in the last 3 days for my family, because they begged for it again after making it the first time. I followed the recipe perfectly the first time and it tasted great. The second time I decided to play around a bit by adding just a pinch of salt and putting the ingredients in a food processor which added a pleasant texture. I would have never thought making it would be so easy! I\u2019m so happy I stumbled onto your blog \ud83d\ude42 Kirbie             \t \u2014 February 10, 2014 @ 1:56 am Reply Yay!

Kirbie             \t \u2014 December 5, 2014 @ 10:33 pm Reply it\u2019s hard for me to figure out what went wrong without being there to watch you make it. I can tell you I\u2019ve made this dozens of times and had friends make it without any issue. My only thought is that you may be measuring the ingredients wrong? You do need to be as exact as possible. For instance, you need to level off your tbsp so you don\u2019t have too much cheese or cream. This is very similar to a regular cheesecake in terms of ingredients\u2013it\u2019s just smaller. So just like a full cheesecake, it should cook and solidify.

I\u2019ve been making homemade cheesecakes from scratch for years (something of a specialty of mine), so the ingredients part wasn\u2019t where I needed help. i was going to try out some mini-cheesecakes (in muffin tins, not mugs but I like that indivual serving idea\u2013a lot!) I got the batter all mixed up and THAT was when I discovered I had no way to cook them. I\u2019m staying with a friend (a guy) who bought a house and its furnishings from an estate sale and the oven has recently decided not to work correctly \u2013 without warning. We have to flip the circuit breaker to cut power or else it seems to go on and just stay on. Baking in self-clean mode (or broiling) isn\u2019t really feasible so I was trying to figure out how to use his circa-1972 microwave to cook these mini-cheesecakes and Googled a bit and came to your blog. Fantastic. I used a silicone muffin pan so it could go from microwave to (broiling) oven and your directions as a guide for how to nuke \u2019em. Worked great to zap the 6-cup pan for about 3:30 rotating half way then jiggling to see if the batter was set. It was not so I used your tip to keep zapping another 20-30 seconds (covered in anticipation of explosions *grin*) and then after I was fairly sure they were set, I slid the pan onto a cookie sheet and ran it \u00a0through this whacko oven for about 2 minutes to brown the edges golden tan and melt the mini-chocolate chips I\u2019d topped them off with for fun. The silicone pans have a tendency to cool quickly so I only had to wait a few minutes before covering with a bit of plastic wrap and slipping them into the fridge. Next time, when I\u2019m back in my own home with functioning 21st century equipment, I look forward to trying out your mug idea. Gonna have to rummage your blog for an apple crisp mug cake now. Apple pies and crisps are my other favorite (and specialty) but like you, I cannot eat a whole one alone and there are only so many occasions in one\u2019s life where one can \u201cbring a dessert\u201d and get a slice for oneself \ud83d\ude42 Kirbie             \t \u2014 February 19, 2015 @ 11:52 am Reply I\u2019m glad you were able to make some mini ones in the silicone. And yes, I hope you give the mug cake version a try. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t have an apple crisp mug cake yet. I really should\u2026But I do have a bazillion other mug cakes for you to try. \u2014 LowCarbLab July 22, 2015 @ 1:43 am Reply I don\u2019t have much time on workdays, so this is a perfect dessert for me. Definitely going to try this out soon. \ud83d\ude42 The pictures are so good! Kirbie             \t \u2014 July 22, 2015 @ 9:14 am Reply hope you enjoy! Ibrahim             \t \u2014 July 22, 2015 @ 4:00 am Reply It was easy and simple Tasted delicious And I should say the this was the first microwave recipe that worked for me So thanks allot Kirbie             \t \u2014 July 22, 2015 @ 9:15 am Reply that\u2019s so awesome to hear! Redhed             \t \u2014 September 10, 2015 @ 11:49 pm Reply Made it with ricotta and yogurt. Makes more than a mugful. Texture is rubbery, edges and surface break. Weeps out a lot of liquid. Use half the vanilla, and don\u2019t make it with crust. I suggest making it in a shallow bowl and transferring it after it\u2019s cooled a few minutes to help it cool down and stop cooking, and so you can drain it. Then make crust and slide drained custard into the crust pan. Kirbie             \t \u2014 September 13, 2015 @ 10:57 pm Reply some of the issues you experienced may be because you used ricotta. andrea             \t \u2014 January 31, 2016 @ 1:03 am Reply this turned out amazing!!!! ahhh im so so happy. usually i\u2019m super skeptic with these mug cake recipes because they always come out dry and slightly rubbery and just not like how they look in pictures. but with this one i was pleasantly satisfied :))) i added a wedge of lime juice since i prefer a slightly tart cheesecake and i only used half a large egg b/c i wasn\u2019t sure if it\u2019d be too much. definitely could have used the whole egg for a more firm consistency but nonetheless it was nice and creamy. i bit looser than a regular cheesecake but it didn\u2019t have neither a uncooked or rubbery texture/taste. five stars im in love!!! thanks so much for sharing \ud83d\ude42 Kirbie             \t \u2014 February 1, 2016 @ 12:38 am Reply yay!! so glad you enjoyed it and thank you for taking the time to let me know! Texas Shopper             \t \u2014 February 15, 2016 @ 5:02 pm Reply Made this tonight for my family of 4. Quadrupled the ingredients, but only used 3 eggs. Used 1/2 cup mixture per mug. Placed all 4 mugs in the microwave and it took 5 minutes. Didn\u2019t bother unmolding them. Chilled in the freezer while we ate dinner. It was the perfect amount to enjoy after dinner. Delicious! For the crust I used the recipe in the back of the container of graham cracker crumbs. Kirbie             \t \u2014 February 17, 2016 @ 9:49 am Reply that is so awesome! so glad you enjoyed it! Diana             \t \u2014 May 25, 2016 @ 4:19 am Reply This was pretty good, but a bit bland. The blandness my be partially my own fault \u2013 I cooked the cheesecake for an extra ten seconds in the microwave, which caused it to crack and may have affected it in other ways. I heated it for a longer time because I wasn\u2019t totally convinced at 2 minutes that it was done, and when it came out after 2 minutes and after 2 minutes 10 seconds, it had a very strong eggy smell. It looked very cute, though, and flipped out pretty well \u2013 only a bit of the crust stuck on to the greased mug. Adding some strawberry and Fat Free ReddiWip helped a lot with adding sweetness, but I think the crust could also have used some extra sweetness. The texture was fine. It did not taste too eggy, despite smelly very eggy when it first came out of the microwave. Kirbie             \t \u2014 May 25, 2016 @ 10:10 am Reply I\u2019m glad you got it work out. There are definitely limitations with a  microwave recipe. It can\u2019t really have all the complex flavors of a traditional cheesecake because you\u2019d have to use more ingredients, mixing with a mixer, etc. But I think it works as a quick fix and, yes, adding some toppings and sauces helps make it better too! Briana             \t \u2014 November 23, 2016 @ 3:17 am Reply Just made this and it turned out wonderful! this is my second time (the first time was the best) and i would continue to make it. But do you know how many calories this equals up to? Kirbie             \t \u2014 November 24, 2016 @ 9:34 am Reply I do not have that information, but I recommend caloriecount website. They have a tool that allows you to input a recipe and it\u2019ll compute all the nutritional information. Hope that helps! Jessica             \t \u2014 May 20, 2017 @ 10:02 am Reply Can this be made without the egg?  Is there a way to modify it if that isn\u2019t the case? Kirbie             \t \u2014 May 23, 2017 @ 9:52 am Reply I have not made an eggless version yet. Sorry! Brit Nicole             \t \u2014 October 24, 2017 @ 10:58 am Reply I just made this without the Greek yogurt/sour cream (mainly because I didn\u2019t have any) the texture was a bit eggy  but I added in more sugar to make the egg taste, it\u2019s pretty good! Helps satisfy the cheesecake craving haha Kirbie             \t \u2014 October 27, 2017 @ 1:14 pm Reply so glad you enjoyed it! Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Welcome to my baking adventures. July 17, 2012 Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Mug Cake Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Mug Cake-perfect when you just want a little something sweet! Mug Cakes! It\u2019s summertime, It\u2019s hot, too hot to have the oven on baking a cake. I remember when microwaves first came out. My grandparents were the first ones to get one. We got one about 3-4 years later. It was their old one, they got a newer, better model. My mom went to town cooking everything she could in it. They came out with special baking dishes and recipe books to\u00a0encourage\u00a0you to cook in this new machine. She even tried to bake cakes a few times but they always came out rubbery and the taste was off. I hated those cakes. Things have come a long way since then. I still\u00a0prefer\u00a0to bake a cake in the oven. The smell of it baking, the crisp outer texture it takes on, the anticipation while it bakes. These just seem right to me. So when you make a microwave mug cake, remember. the baking aroma will only last a minute. This little cake was surprisingly good and with a scoop of ice cream, perfect for a hot summer day treat!

Today\u2019s recipe is kind of a reinvention of one  I\u2019ve already done. I altered it just a bit to make it more cakey instead of muffiny. What I love about single serve recipes is the portion control. It\u2019s hard for me to make a batch of muffins or cookies and \u201cjust have one.\u201d Hence my love for single serve! While this recipe uses gluten free flour mix (instead of a whole grain), it doesn\u2019t have any refined sugars! It really is a Fit Foodie Favorite. On my agenda for this weekend is 1. Go to bootcamp this morning at Lululemon in St. Paul! MY OTHER VIDEOS 2. Prep a few more recipe posts for throughout the week. 3. Pack for ski trip to Colorado! 4.

I often make it without the chocolate, but pour a little maple syrup over the top when its done, per Diana\u2019s suggestion.  I\u2019m pretty crazy with banana ratios \u2013 it can get a little soupy if I put in too much banana.  Also, I bake at 350 for 25 minutes.  Works for my oven.  Thanks for the inspiration!

But I was so in the mood for a banana cake, and I knew I couldn\u2019t make a whole cake because I\u2019d eat it all (:P), so I decided to try this recipe and I\u2019m so glad I did.

And let me start out by saying that I am super skeptical of gluten-free cookies. \u00a0Skeptical in buying them at the store and nervous to make them on my own. \u00a0I've come up with a few recipes  that have more than satisfied my cookie cravings but there is a specific texture I still had yet to create or find. \u00a0The chewy, gooey, sticky oatmeal chocolate chip cookie texture. This recipe solves that problem. The oatmeal cookie of my dreams. \u00a0The best gluten-free cookie I've ever eaten. \u00a0Not to mention vegan, single-serving, and can be made in 1 bowl with 1 fork using minimal ingredients in about 3 minutes. \u00a0The most non-fuss cookie ever. If I had the choice between a regular chocolate chip cookie and an oatmeal chocolate chip cookie I will pick the oatmeal cookie 100% of the time. \u00a0Rolled oats add such a nutty delicious flavor and an addictingly chewy texture you just can't get when using flour alone. The best part about this recipe is that you can bake it exactly to your liking. \u00a0Since there is no egg it doesn't matter how \"done\" it ends up. \u00a0Underbake it, overbake it, eat the raw dough for all I care! \u00a0Whatever you want! My cookie texture of choice has a slightly crispy edge with a doughy, tacky center. \u00a0Not tacky like socks with sandals but tacky like sticky and chewy. \u00a0I could eat these all day for the texture alone! \u00a0And trust me this didn't come after one lucky try. \u00a0This recipe was not an accident. \u00a0I made at least 7 trials playing with very small ratios of flour, oats, oil, sugar, etc. until it was just perfect. Well, perfect for me, anyway. \u00a0But hopefully you like it as well. \u00a0This cookie is the real deal. Or maybe it's been so long since I've had a real \u00a0cookie that my brain has been a skewed vision of what a real \u00a0cookie is. Or not. Print this! inspired by: deep-dish whole wheat vegan chocolate chip cookie Single-Serving Deep Dish Chocolate Chip Cookie gluten-free, vegan // yields 1 serving 2 teaspoons unrefined coconut oil, softened not melted 2 teaspoons brown rice syrup 1 1/2 teaspoons muscovado \u00a0sugar, or [vegan] light brown sugar 1/4 teaspoon vanilla bean paste, or vanilla extract 1/8 teaspoon baking powder 3 tablespoons gluten-free rolled oats 1 tablespoon gluten-free oat flour 1 tablespoon almond meal 1-1 1/2 tablespoons dark [vegan] chocolate chips pinch of flaked sea salt, to top Preheat your oven to 350* F and take out a 3 or 4-inch ramekin dish. In a small bowl mash the coconut oil, brown rice syrup, muscovado sugar, vanilla, and baking powder together until fully combined + creamy. Do not  use melted coconut oil. Add the oats, oat flour, and almond meal, then mash with a fork until a dough forms that is sticky and holds together. ~30 seconds Mix in the chocolate chips. Press firmly into the ramekin dish then top with a small pinch of flaked sea salt and bake for 11-13 minutes [for a 4-inch ramekin] or less/more depending on your texture preference. \u00a0For a 3-inch ramekin bake for 15-17 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for at least 7-10 minutes. \u00a0The cookie will firm up and become chewier as it cools. Serve slightly warm or fully cooled. \u00a0The cookie will stay chewy when fully cooled. notes/substitution:\u00a0 \u00a0The brown rice syrup helps create a chewy texture but maple syrup will also work. \u00a0For making 3 cookies instead of the cookie pie see directions below. Don't feel like smashing the dough into a ramekin dish? \u00a0Roll 3 balls of dough, place them on a cookie sheet 2-inches apart, flatten them, and bake for about 7-9 minutes [at 350*]. \u00a0Let them cool for 5 minutes then transfer to a cooling rack. \u00a0The cookies will firm up as they cool and stay chewy once fully cooled. slightly And then there's the option of serving the cookie pie a la mode. \u00a0The ice cream cools the warm cookie making it even chewier, while at the same time melting into ice cream soup. \u00a0My two favorite things together at last. And here is the whopping sinkful of dishes you'll have to clean when you're all done. Why aren't you in the kitchen yet?

This is getting out of hand. Looking back, I just realized there hasn't been a day in the last- oh, I don't know- EVER, that I haven't had chocolate in some way shape or form. It's a crazy love for the stuff. A yearning. A desire as strong as Channing Tatum's abs. A BURNING PASSION IN MY SOOOOOUL. I'll stop. I've come to the mature decision to feed this obsession in a good, healthy way. Although  if you ask me, chocolate is pretty healthy in and of itself. It's just probably not very good if you go and eat the whole bar of chocolate, batch of brownies, pint of ice cream\u2026 You get my gist.\u00a0I'll admit.\u00a0I basically eat chocolate in every single way possible.\u00a0In my oatmeal? Dunnniiitttt. Definitely not a bad idea, if you're wondering. Smoothies? Check. Healthy brownies? Shooosh yahhhh. Eaten the whole dang pan, in fact! But let's not go there. AND NOW. COOKIES. Actually, cookiEEEEE. Just for you and your pretty little chocolate loving face. This cookie is kind of sort of a freaking SUCCCCESSSS. I've tried making a healthy single serving cookie before and oh my gross, you guys. So did not work. That experience kind of scarred me for life and I was hesitant about trying out a new recipe. Thank heavens I did though. I basically saved all of humanity with this cookie. {things get baaaaad if I don't satisfy my cravings fast.} This cookie is going to blow your mind. It's soft and chewy AND CHOCOLATEY. So much chocolate. So much happiness. GET EXCITED. The cookie itself is like a little hunk 'a fudgalicious brownie. And if that couldn't get any better, I pressed some of my beloved 70% on the top. And if THAT couldn't get any better\u2026 Sea salt. This is just pure chocolatey, fudgey greatness made JUST for you in a matter of minutes. It's actually healthy too. I know, weird huh? WHOOODA THUUUUNKED IT? It's dairy-free, gluten-free, and processed sugar free. Which MEANS. You can eat it for breakfast. With a cup of hot coffee? Oh my gosh, that is like. Heaven. Like suddenly, all is right in the world while you dip your fudgey cookie in a ginormous mug of coffee. No more werrrrrrds. \u2026\u2026 Except I do have a few more. My sincerest apologies. You know that song \"Give Me Love\" by Ed Sheeran? I am making a parody\u2026 Caaaaaalled. {drumroll please.} \"Give Me Fudge\".\u00a0Give me FUUUUUUUUHHUUUUDGE\u2026 Hmmmm myyy myyyuhhhh hmmm myyyyyy myuuhhh. Give me fuuuuuuudgeeeeee.\u00a0I sure hope you've heard that song before because otherwise, you're totally thinking I'm a fool right now. And you would be correct. Ok, thanks for listening! Now go make yerrrsehhhlf a cookie. XXL dark chocolate & sea salt brownie cookie 1 egg 1 1/2 tbsp. coconut oil 1 tbsp. nut butter {I used peanut butter. duh.} dash of vanilla 2 tbsp. pure maple syrup 1/4 c. gluten-free flour 2 tbsp. unsweetened cocoa powder 1/2 tsp. baking powder pinch of sea salt 1 square 70% cocoa dark chocolate, roughly chopped Preheat oven to 350\u00baF and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. In a small bowl, combine egg, coconut oil, nut butter, vanilla, and maple syrup. Add flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and sea salt. Transfer to prepared baking sheet and form into a disk. Press dark chocolate chunks onto the top of the cookie and sprinkle with sea salt. Bake for 10-15 minutes. Posted by Sophie at 4:24:00 AM Email This BlogThis!

I found lots of info subbing vice versa, but just wondering if I'm not avoiding gluten ;) Reply Delete Replies Sophie October 4, 2013 at 11:00 PM Hahaha, yes of course you can!

Delete Reply Mrs. Wonderful January 11, 2014 at 8:38 PM I used Bob's Red Mill gluten-free pancake mix for the GF flour (and skipped the baking powder). I noticed the mix was more like a batter so I added another 2T of pancake mix. I poured it into a parchment paper-lined mini loaf pan. It was done after 12 minutes. Even though it wasn't the cookie I'd planned, it made a delightful, chocolatey cake that was light and had great flavor. No one would ever know it was gluten free! Reply Delete Replies Sophie January 21, 2014 at 3:48 AM Hmm. I wonder why it turned out so differently. It may have been because the gluten-free pancake mix had added leavening agents that changed up the texture. Either way, I'm glad you enjoyed it!

Reply Delete whatwhat September 4, 2015 at 9:01 AM At almost 700 calories and 40 grams of fat, this is hardly a healthy cookie.

Happy Hump Day! I visited my new nephew, Matthew, yesterday afternoon. He\u2019s only a day older since the last time I saw him, but he\u2019s already so different. The first day I saw him when he was only 24 hours old, he just slept and didn\u2019t do much. Yesterday, though, he had his eyes open, he was squirming around, and he even sneezed a few times. He\u2019s so cool. Four generations: My sister, Mom, Grammie, and Matthew! Lunch My mom and I brought lunch to my sister\u2019s house yesterday and kept it simple with make-your-own-sandwiches. My sister and her husband have barely slept since Matthew was born, so we wanted to make things as easy as possible for them. We also stocked their fridge with lots of delicious food, so they don\u2019t need to do too much cooking in the coming days while they try to get into a routine with Matthew and begin to adjust to their new life. Snack When I got home from visiting Matthew, I had a major craving for chocolate chip cookie dough, so I got a little creative in the kitchen and whipped up a gluten-free and egg-free batch using almond butter, almond flour, honey, vanilla extract, and white chocolate chips. It turned out so well and totally satisfied my craving\u201d\u201dI just ate it straight from the bowl! Mmm! Ingredients : 2 heaping tbsp creamy almond butter 1/4 cup almond flour 2 tbsp chocolate morsels 1 tsp vanilla extract 1-2 tsp honey 1/8 tsp sea salt Directions : Combine ingredients in a small bowl. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Grab a spoon and enjoy! MY LATEST RECIPES Workout At CrossFit yesterday, the Skill part of our workout was selecting a goal for July, writing it on the Goal Board, and then working on it for 15 minutes. I picked a Muscle Up . I\u2019ve made some decent progress this year with many of my CrossFit skills, but the Muscle Up is just something I haven\u2019t worked on at all. It actually sort of scares me, and, for some reason, I think it\u2019s totally out of my reach, which definitely won\u2019t help me achieve this goal. I figured if I set this goal and aimed high, I\u2019d spend a lot of time working on it and maybe not get a Muscle Up in July, but make enough progress that I will in August or September. I think half the battle is committing to a new goal and actually working at it, so, hopefully, I\u2019ll make some progress in the coming months. Questions of the Day Do you have a niece/nephew?

Introducing: a microwave for one! It\u2019s vegan, too. Pumpkin Oatmeal Cookie This healthy, soft, and chewy \u201ccookie\u201d is packed with fiber and healthy fat, making it a great breakfast or snack, and it couldn\u2019t be easier to make \u2013 all you need is the microwave! I was in the mood for something pumpkin-y for breakfast yesterday; I originally considered my Pumpkin Pie Oatmeal  or Pumpkin Pie Smoothie  but I wanted to try something new. Since I had to get down to work, it needed to be fast, and I didn\u2019t want to make anything that would leave a ton of leftovers lying around since we\u2019ll be going out of town this weekend. A single serving oatmeal cookie, made in the microwave? Sounded like a good challenge to me. To add sweetness without needing sugar, I used mashed super ripe banana (applesauce would also work here if you\u2019re not a banana fan) and Almond Breeze  vanilla almondmilk. I also added some nut butter (I used cashew butter, but any kind is fine) and ground flaxseed to help bind it together and add some healthy fats. MY OTHER RECIPES This recipe is perfect for those afternoons when you want something like a cookie\u2026 but that will tide you over for more than 30 seconds. The cookie comes out soft and chewy \u2013 kind of like a muffin top! Serves 1COOKIE adjust servings Microwave Pumpkin Oatmeal Cookie for one Prep Time 5 MINUTES Prep Time Cook Time 5 MINUTES Cook Time Total Time 10 mins Total Time shopping list print Ingredients 1 very ripe banana, mashed (or applesauce - 1/4 C) 3 Tbsp. Almond Breeze vanilla almondmilk 3 Tbsp. rolled oats 2 Tbsp. pumpkin (canned is fine) 1 Tbsp. nut butter (any kind) 3 tsp. raisins or other dried fruit 2 tsp. ground flaxseed 1/2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice 1/4 tsp. cinnamon Instructions Combine and mix all ingredients in a lightly greased/cooking sprayed or nonstick microwave safe bowl. Microwave on high for 4 to 5 minutes. Let cool and enjoy! by Anne @ fANNEtastic food Looks like Matt\u2019s jack-o-lantern wanted a taste, too\u2026 :) I ate the first half of the cookie plain, then decided to mix it up and threw some cottage cheese on top for protein and some blueberries on the side, too. Also delicious! I loved the spiced flavor the pumpkin pie spice and cinnamon gave to it. Very fall-esque. I hope you guys will give this recipe a try and love it as much as I did! Have you ever made a cookie in the microwave before?  I\u2019ve seen a few different microwave cookie recipes floating around on the internet.

Reply 2 Hannah @ CleanEatingVeggieGirl says: October 30, 2013 at 12:44 pm Yum!!  I cannot wait to try this!  I love that it only makes one serving :). Reply 3 Jessica says: October 30, 2013 at 12:56 pm This sounds yummy! Can\u2019t wait to try it! Many microwave cookies that I see online have eggs on them, and I\u2019m always concerned about food management, so I don\u2019t try them because I don\u2019t think an egg would be cook in one minute! Thanks for the recipe!!!! Reply 4 Jojo @ RunFastEatLots says: October 30, 2013 at 1:12 pm I\u2019ve made microwave \u201ccake\u201d before, but wasn\u2019t really a fan. I think a cookie would work out better, especially a soft style cookie :P Reply 5 Jackie says: October 30, 2013 at 1:30 pm Yum! I got try this! Reply 6 Heather says: October 30, 2013 at 1:40 pm I\u2019m always down for a new pumpkin recipe to try! Sounds yummy!

Reply 8 Taylor @ Single-tracked Mind says: October 30, 2013 at 2:34 pm This recipe looks like the perfect snack! Brilliant! Reply 9 Allison says: October 30, 2013 at 3:27 pm OH YUM!!! I am definitely going to try it!!! Reply 10 Amy says: October 30, 2013 at 9:31 pm Hi Anne, just so you know, 3 tsp is the equivalent of 1 tbsp (in the recipe you used 1 T and then 3 t but they are actually the same- not sure if you knew this!). Also, pumpkin pie spice already contains cinnamon, along with nutmeg, cloves, and ginger :) They are just mixed together already for you in normal baking proportions Reply 11 Anne says: October 30, 2013 at 9:45 pm I did know 3 tsp was the equivalent of 1 Tbsp, but totally forgot to make that change when I wrote down the recipe since I was using the tsp! And yes, I know PP spice includes all those things \u2013 I just wanted to add extra cinnamon cause it rocks. :) Reply 12 Ashley says: November 1, 2013 at 8:24 am Anne, Did you use the entire banana in your recipe? I did and it turned out way too runny and was a sort of pumpkin pancake, but really mushy. I\u2019m thinking that since the whole banana would not be equivalent to 1/4 cup applesauce that I should have used 1/4 cup mashed banana? BTW I love your blog \u2013 I\u2019m doing my dietetic internship right now! Reply 13 Anne says: November 1, 2013 at 9:29 am I did use an entire banana, but it was a smaller banana. Hmm\u2026 that\u2019s weird. Maybe you\u2019re right \u2013 try a smaller amount or a smaller banana? Thank you for reading \u2013 good luck with your internship! :) Reply 14 Tara | Treble in the Kitchen says: November 1, 2013 at 1:41 pm Yum! I totally want to try this tonight :) Reply 15 Cindy says: December 3, 2015 at 3:39 pm Could I use almond flour/meal in place of the flax seed or maybe wheat germ?  What is your opinion on the Trim Healthy Mama eating plan? Reply 16 Anne says: December 3, 2015 at 4:48 pm Sure, almond flour or wheat germ would work fine I think. I haven\u2019t heard of that eating plan \u2014 sorry! Reply 17 Laura says: April 23, 2017 at 10:48 am HI Anne, Is the nutritional content for this cookie available?

[ excited-panic \u00a0ensues] Oh, yea? Do ya? Ok, let\u2019s go for a walk. Bring your green leash! (That\u2019s pretty much word-for-word what I said to Murphy before his walk this afternoon. I talk to him a lot.) Snack On my way out the door to walk Murphy, I grabbed a handful of almonds to snack on. I planned to make dinner as soon as I returned home, but I wanted a little something to munch on. MY LATEST RECIPES On my pug walks lately, I\u2019ve been listening to the Balanced Bites podcasts , which focus on \u201ca practical approach to holistic and Paleo nutrition with a healthy dose of humor.\u201d\u009d They\u2019re hosted by Diane Sanfilippo (of Balanced Bites  and author of ) and Liz Wolfe (of Practical Paleo Cave Girl Eats ). I\u2019ve only listened to two so far, but I like them a lot, and I\u2019m learning a ton! The podcast I finished this morning was with Chris Kresser \u00a0and talked about small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), maintaining healthy gut flora, and the best nutritional approaches for healing the gut and proper digestion. It was all very interesting and my gut needs healing in a bad way, so I\u2019m going to try a couple of things that they suggested, including bone broth . Bone tea? Ooh, boy! Accept and adjust  and heal my gut! Dinner After my walk with Murphy, I came home and threw together a quick Cobb Salad (minus the bacon) for dinner. After dinner, I had a craving for something sweet, specifically a cookie, so I whipped up one in the microwave using just 5 ingredients. OMG, it turned out so well\u201d\u201dmoist, soft, and delicious! Yum!!! And, of course, you can get all crazy with this recipe and add chocolate chips, raisins, flavored extracts, etc. Microwaveable Nut Butter Cookie for One Ingredients: 2 tbsp nut butter 2 tbsp liquid egg whites 1-2 tsp honey 1/4 tsp baking powder 1/8 tsp cinnamon Directions: Coat a microwaveable-safe bowl with nonstick cooking spray. Then, combine all of the ingredients in the bowl and mix well. Microwave for 60 seconds. Enjoy!

Dessert for breakfast anyone?! I mean delicious chocolate dessert with healthy fats, complex carbs, fiber and protein. And only 275 calories. This Chocolate Chia Pudding is creamy, rich and fudgy chocolate heaven. If you tried it with closed eyes, you would think it\u2019s a chocolate mousse. I promise, it\u2019s delicious! I had a hard time deciding on a category for this Chocolate Chia Pudding. Let\u2019s have it for breakfast. Then there is one more thing, besides coffee, to look forward to in the morning. Although I love mornings and you don\u2019t have to kick me out of bed to get up. Especially when I have this waiting for me in the fridge. Oh my. Seeing how much you liked Vanilla Chia Pudding , I was curious to create more. Just wait until Sunday. Even my friend Christi, who is an avid fan of everything butter and cream, bought a bag of chia seeds, made the pudding and loved it! With 3 little kids and a full-time job, she loved the convenience of a 5 minute overnight breakfast. And you can prep chia pudding for up to 5 days in advance. No sugary cereal will beat that. And it\u2019s so easy to make, it\u2019s embarrassing. Add liquids first instead of pouring milk on top of chia seeds and trying to scrape tiny seeds off the bottom of the jar to mix. Plus cocoa/cacao powder takes time to combine evenly with the milk. Recently I switched from cocoa to cacao powder. Raw cacao powder  is unadulterated and contains many more nutrients than traditional cocoa powder. Plus I find it has very rich taste and isn\u2019t more bitter than cocoa powder. Chia seeds themselves are pretty tasteless and expand up to 9 times of their original size. You can add chia to salads, smoothies, baked goods and pretty much anything. I usually buy a 2 lb bag of Nutiva chia seeds at Costco. Just like this one . And a little goes a long way. So, chia is not really expensive if you live in North America. Add chia seeds and cocoa/cacao powder and whisk with a small whisk  (if you have) really well. Until cacao powder is dissolved. Some tiny cacao powder lumps are OK. You will be steering again in the morning. One time my tiny whisk was in the dishwasher, I used fork with no problem to stir the pudding. Refrigerate for at least 6 hours or overnight. When ready to eat, give your chocolate chia pudding another good stir. Sometimes you might have lumps due to gulps of air in-between the chia seeds and that\u2019s OK. There also will be foam on top from whisking the night before. That\u2019s fine too. Just stir really well with a spoon or fork. No whisking is necessary. This chocolate chia pudding is 2 thumbs up. Will pass for a chocolate dessert to anyone with closed eyes. I\u2019m saying that not because it\u2019s my recipe, but because it\u2019s delicious! Chia pudding tastes like something in between tapioca pudding, mousse and Greek yogurt. It melts in your mouth and is creamy and rich. I swear it\u2019s equivalent to eating a chocolate bar but so much healthier. This whole jar for 275 calories. And it\u2019s a perfect breakfast on-the-go. I heard some people do but I do not have any issues with any chia seeds stuck in my mouth afterwards (pardon the details). Well, maximum five. Drink a glass of water after and do your body even more good. I like my chocolate chia pudding to fall off the spoon. Feel free to adjust the consistency to your taste by playing around with the amount of milk. It was my first time trying chia pudding with stevia and I absolutely loved the result. No unpleasant aftertaste as in some baked goods with stevia. Adjust the amount of sweetener to your taste as well. Enjoy! Print Chocolate Chia Pudding Recipe Ingredients 3/4 cup almond (rice, soy, hemp, coconut) milk, unsweetened 2 tsp maple syrup/honey or 1/4 tsp stevia 1 tsp pure vanilla extract 3 - 4 tbsp chia seeds * 1 tbsp cocoa or cacao powder , unsweetened Directions Add all ingredients to a Mason jar  or any container with a tight lid (I prefer glass ) in the order listed above - liquids first. Whisk well or stir vigorously with a fork until cacao powder is well combined with the rest of ingredients. Refrigerate for at least 6 hours or overnight. When ready to eat, stir well again. Some lumps are OK, just stir well. The thickness and sweetness can be adjusted to your taste. Storage Instructions: Refrigerate for up to 5 days. Notes * For a thick consistency pudding use 4 tbsp chia seeds, for soup like consistency (pictured) use only 3 tbsp (my favourite). 3.1 http://ifoodreal.com/chocolate-chia-pudding-recipe/ The recipe and images are property and copyright of iFOODreal.com Nutritional Info Servings Per Recipe: 1 Calories: 275.5 Total Fat: 12 g Cholesterol: 0.0 mg Sodium: 185.2 mg Total Carbs: 28.4 g Dietary Fiber: 17.0 g Protein: 11 g WW Points+: 6 Related Recipes Banana Chia Pudding Vanilla Chia Pudding Healthy Brown Rice Pudding Lemon Blueberry Chia Pudding Coconut Mango Chia Pudding This post may contain affiliate links.

I got so excited about trying out this pudding that I accidentally used flax seeds instead of chia seeds!!:(( Should I toss the pudding and make a new one with chia seeds, or will flax seeds be just fine? I know they have many similarities but want to know your input on this situation. March 26th, 2014 Reply Olena Oh my.:) It\u2019s OK. Save your flax seeds pudding and add a bit of it at a time to your chia puddings. Don\u2019t throw out good stuff.:) I would make new chia pudding though.:) March 26th, 2014 Reply Barbara I imagine it won\u2019t work at all with flax.

May 8th, 2014 Reply Olena 500 ml Mason jar is good enough. I would say the pudding expands up to 1.5 \u2013 2 times. May 8th, 2014 Reply Monica I tried this recipe and it turned out very thin. Should I just reduce the amount of milk? June 8th, 2014 Reply Olena Sure. You can adjust the thickness of pudding with the amount of milk. I like thin consistency but my husband likes thick.:) June 8th, 2014 Reply Stacy Westman This looks fantastic! I mixed up a couple of jars and can\u2019t wait to try them. I posted a link to you on my blog \ud83d\ude42 Thanks for sharing. July 13th, 2014 Reply Laura I made this last night.  I followed the directions to a \u201cT\u201d, but it came out very thin and the chia seeds are still a bit crunchy.  Not sure what else I can to get it to a mousse-like texture. August 13th, 2014 Reply Olena Hi Laura. Chia pudding will never have a mousse like consistency since chia seeds are seeds and do not dissolve. To adjust thickness add a tbsp of chia or more and stir really well. Consistency is very personal preference. August 13th, 2014 Reply Grace If you add 2tsp more chia, let sit, then blend the mixture in a blender it will be just like pudding. November 4th, 2016 Reply Judy Hill I was so looking forward to eatings this for breakfast this morning but it was like chocolate soup. I had almond milk in the fridge but it was expired so I used 2 percent milk. I followed all other directions except I used Holy Crap Chia breakfast which is basically just chia seed. I ended up adding quinoa just to thicken it a bit. I liked it but wanted more of a pudding texture. September 3rd, 2014 Reply Olena Consistency is a personal preference. Following the recipe my chia pudding turned out as pictured. It is important to stir it well after soaking, even the seeds from the bottom of the jar. I explain it in details in the post followed by pictures. For a thicker consistency, mix 3/4 cup milk with 4 tbsp chia seeds next time.:) September 3rd, 2014 Reply Misa Pad Mir i just did it for a birthday gift for my best girl friend <3 September 4th, 2014 Reply LunaMoth can i use regular milk if i dont have any other? i really want to make this tonight (huge choco craving) and ill buy soy milk later this week. September 8th, 2014 Reply Olena Yes, sure. September 8th, 2014 Reply Alexa McAllister Oh, I must try this again. Making it now! December 15th, 2014 Reply Destiny I made the vanilla and did not like it. It was like gel and did not like the flavor. I used ground chia seeds\u2026 is that the problem?? January 13th, 2015 Reply Olena Chia pudding should be made with whole chia seeds. Having said that, not sure if you will like it that way either. I wouldn\u2019t like the ground chia texture either unless it is blended until very smooth. January 13th, 2015 Reply Kathy this is so good! February 13th, 2015 Reply Paula Steinmiller This looks so delicious. Can I use my Vitamix high speed blender to blend the pudding instead of a whisk. I would then put it in a mason jar and let it soak in the fridge. February 23rd, 2015 Reply Olena Um, technically yes but be careful not to ground chia seeds. I would blend everything except chia in a blender and then either whisk in chia by hand or give it just a few pulses to combine. February 23rd, 2015 Reply Jenna If this is going in a mason jar, why do we have to whisk it? Can\u2019t we just screw on the lid and shake it? March 6th, 2015 Reply Olena Because cacao powder has a hard time dissolving in liquid and your chia pudding might be lumpy and lack taste. March 6th, 2015 Reply Jen It really works better to mix cocoa with chia seeds first, then add it to warm \u2018milk\u2019 while whisking \u2013 no lumps and thickens quicker as it needs only about 45-60 minutes to cool :0). March 10th, 2015 Reply Olena That\u2019s a good idea! March 11th, 2015 Reply Lynn @ Oh-So Yummy Found this recipe yesterday and ate this morning! Quick assembly made it super easy for me to actually eat breakfast for once! Perfect for to-go! It tastes like chocolate pudding with some extra nibble in it. March 12th, 2015 Reply Steph Well I have no idea what i\u2019m doing wrong.  I\u2019ve followed this recipe to the letter, and all I end up with is horrible gloop.  I\u2019ve tried using whisks, forks, reducing the milk, increasing the chia seeds.  Chocolatey soup rather than a nice, light mousse \ud83d\ude41 March 17th, 2015 Reply Olena Maybe overall you just expect chia pudding to be different than what it can be?! March 17th, 2015 Reply Sarah Hi there- just wondering how it comes out to 12g of fat? I\u2019ve just started chia puddings like this for lunch. Love them! March 18th, 2015 Reply Olena Chia seeds are high in Omega-3s that are good for you! This is good fat that doesn\u2019t make you fat so don\u2019t worry and enjoy! http://authoritynutrition.com/11-proven-health-benefits-of-chia-seeds/ March 19th, 2015 Reply Faneena Stumbled upon this recipe while looking up homemade chocolate pudding recipes and gave this a go last night. I went with 3 tbsp\u2019s of chia seeds since i prefer the soup consistency but after stirring it this morning it looked right (and tasted pretty good) but it was like one giant glob haha. I used almond milk but i guess i\u2019ll have to play with this a little more to try to get the consistency right\u2026unless it will always glob? i thought it\u2019d be more like tapioca pudding? In any case thanks for the recipe \ud83d\ude42 i\u2019d been looking for ways to use my chia seeds since im a chia seed newbie March 19th, 2015 Reply Olena I honestly have never tried tapioca pudding. You can really adjust consistency with liquid. Chia seeds are awesome!!! March 19th, 2015 Reply Sherwood I\u2019ve really started to fall in love with chia pudding. I have a bunch of recipes collected to try, but I wanted to explore the basics before going into some of the crazier options. So I made this the other day, and it was fantastic! I keep getting surprised by the subtle sweetness of the healthy things I\u2019ve been making, and that happened with this, too. Great richness to the chocolate flavor, and I got a wonderful texture out of 4 tbsp of chia seeds. I like my pudding to fight back. lol My roommate, who eats all sorts of processed garbage, couldn\u2019t detect any sweetness and called this a good \u201cpalate cleanser.\u201d That made me a little bit sad. October 6th, 2015 Reply Olena Hi Sherwood. Good for you! DOn\u2019t be sad or offended, I used to. Try to eat a serving of ice cream and then chocolate chia pudding. Your tastebuds will be so overpowered by added sugar you won\u2019t taste any natural sugar in the chia pudding. Processed foods screw up palettes big time! So keep calm and make chia pudding.:) October 7th, 2015 Reply Sara So I found this a few days ago and tried it and liked it but I always want something hot for breakfast. I made a basic chia pudding last night with the milk and seeds then this morning threw in about a tbs of semi sweet chocolate chips then heated it up until hot. Stirred it all together until the melted chips were incorporated and I gotta say- it was pretty damned fantastic. About the same sugar content as using the honey option too. Have you tried it hot? You should if you wasn\u2019t \ud83d\ude42 February 27th, 2016 Reply Olena I should try it got, Sara. Never thought of that. Thanks. February 28th, 2016 Reply Natalie This is so delicious! I made it with coconut milk instead of almond milk, as it\u2019s what I had on hand. Reminded me of my all-time favorite dessert, chocolate mousse! THANK YOU! May 15th, 2016 Reply Olena Awesome, Natalie! May 16th, 2016 Reply Martha Sluder I subbed 2 tbsp. Xylitol for the honey and maple syrup to cut down carbs, and it is delicious.  I plan to sprinkle on Hemp seeds to raise the protein,  because eating it all is too much chocolate for one meal for me.  Thanks for sharing! May 18th, 2016 Reply Olena You are welcome, Martha! May 19th, 2016 Reply AlexaMc Allister Chia seeds on my shopping list again. Tis ages since I last made this . October 27th, 2016 Reply Olena I go through waves too. 2 weeks ago I made like 10 jars and since then nada. I buy chia seeds at Costco so it\u2019s hard to run out lmao. October 27th, 2016 Reply Aya Got my Nutiva chia seeds from Costco as well! The cacao powder was a bit of a pain to mix to ensure no clumps but it was sooo worth it. Many other recipes for the pudding have lots of ingredients, so it was awesome that yours had items I had on hand! Thanks for sharing January 22nd, 2017 Reply Olena Use a whisk. Also let chia pudding sit for 5 minutes after the first mix and stir again. It soaks up some liquid almost immediately and is easier to mix. Less is more.:) January 23rd, 2017 Reply Amy Very tasty! I love it and at least one of my kids likes it (I think if I cut the cinnamon the other one will like it too).Thanks for the recipe! May 23rd, 2017 Reply Noelle Hi there! My Naturopath wants me to give up grains for a while, so I was looking for an alternative for breakfast, and looked up chia pudding. I tried this recipe today, and though I liked it I found it was-for me anyway, a bit bland. Now I am not sure if it wasn\u2019t sweet enough, though I followed the recipe exactly with honey to sweeten..maybe I\u2019ll try maple syrup next time. I added some strawberries and banana chopped which helped.:) What do you think I might have done wrong? Used coconut milk (unsweetened) btw, and the raw cacao\u2026it just didn\u2019t seem like I could taste the chocolate! I\u2019m not giving up, trying your vanilla chia pudding next! Thank you, lovely website! \ud83d\ude42 August 6th, 2017 Reply Olena Hi Noelle. You can add another tsp of cacao powder and more honey or maple syrup to taste. Also chocolate chips will help.:) I don\u2019t think you have done anything wrong, everyone has different taste buds. Thank you and enjoy! August 8th, 2017 Reply Noelle Hi Olena! Well, I tried it again, and again\u2026and have it every morning now pretty much! I added 1 and then eventually 2 tsp of maple syrup instead of the honey, the coconut milk, with or without 1 tsp of raw cacao powder (like it better with because it has that weird grey look without lol!) and add some fruit and I LOVE it! I\u2019ve only tried it with your version of 3 tbsp of chia seeds, and it\u2019s perfect for me\u2026thanks for the feedback! \ud83d\ude42 August 28th, 2017 Reply Olena Perfect! Sometimes it\u2019s just a few tweaks to suit your personal taste.

Want to follow our adventures? Find us on Facebook , Instagram  or Pinterest! Thursday, August 9, 2012 Recipe: Quick and Easy Stovetop Rice Pudding Did you know that today, August 9th is National Rice Pudding Day? Well.. since I don't live in the US and Australia doesn't have cool food holidays, I'm proudly proclaiming that it is International  Rice Pudding Day! Why? Because everyone should enjoy rice pudding! Today, in celebration of this marvelous day, I wanted to share with you my Quick and Easy Rice Pudding Recipe. It's made on the stovetop and uses leftover rice, saving you tonnes of cooking time! I love to make this rice pudding for breakfast with leftover brown rice and add in dried fruit, nuts, banana, apple or top it with some nut butter! It's healthy, eggless, gluten free, low fat and low sugar (though you can add as much or as little as you like) and can also be made Vegan if you choose a non-dairy milk! What is Rice Pudding? To put it simply, rice pudding is a dish made from rice mixed with milk. Other ingredients can be added and it can be made as a sweet or savoury dish. Personally, I like my rice pudding sweet and mine always needs to have cinnamon! One popular add in for rice pudding is raisins - if you cook them in they plump up and add a delicious flavour! Rice pudding was actually first made in Asia to aid the malnourished, however over thousands of years, thousands of recipes has developed in countries world wide. A traditional English Rice Pudding tends to use milk, sugar and raisins with nutmeg and/or cinnamon. Rice pudding can be baked or made on the stove top with each having a different flavour and consistency. Quick and Easy Stovetop Rice Pudding Recipe Healthy, low fat, eggless, gluten free and delicious - can be vegan too! Serves one! ~1/2 cup cooked rice 3/4 cup milk of your choice 1 tsp vanilla Sugar/sweetener to taste Pinch of salt Optional:  ~1/2 tsp Cinnamon In a small non-stick saucepan, add all of the ingredients. Turn the heat to high and bring mixture to the boil. Once the milk has started to bubble and boil, reduce the heat to medium. Cover the saucepan with a lid and leave to simmer, stirring every now and again. Once the milk really starts to reduce, take the lid off and stir frequently so it doesn't stick to the pan. When it reaches your desired consistency, pour the rice pudding out of the saucepan and into a bowl and leave to cool for a few minutes before eating. Note:  This rice pudding also tastes amazing cold - in the summer I make up a double batch ahead of time and keep it in the fridge. For the rice: In the picture I used cooked brown rice, however, I have also used white rice, red rice and black rice in the past. Before I went gluten free, I also tried it with cooked barley, so I'm sure it would work with other grains as well. For the milk: I generally use low fat cows milk or unsweetened almond milk, but the choice is yours! For the sweetener: For me it has enough sweetness on it's own, but if I'm feeling like it needs more sweetener I will add in a small amount of maple syrup or cane sugar. Feel free to use any sweetener you like - honey, sugar, date sugar, coconut sugar - the list goes on! If you're in a real hurry: Some mornings I just can't be bothered waiting 10-15 minutes for the milk to reduce. On these days, I skip putting the lid on and stir the rice frequently until the milk absorbs. It doesn't make such a creamy consistency but it still tastes delicious. So tell me, are you a rice pudding fan? What do you like to have in yours? Traditionally speaking, I'd have to say cinnamon, raisins and a dash of nutmeg (baked is even better!) - but for breakfast, I love mixing in a mashed banana and topping it with nuts or nut butter or having it with other dried fruit and nuts. My current favourite combination is dates and almond butter! Posted by Kristy Sayer-Jones @ Southern In Law Email This BlogThis!

Rice pudding is definitely one of my favourites :) Delete Reply Anonymous December 24, 2012 at 10:54 AM Rice pudding is something you can buy in the store in a pack and it only takes 3 minutes to cook in milk. Also, we have it in the refrigerated section with topping like cinnamon, strawberry and vanilla sauce! :) Since i am living in the states now (i am german and 21 years old, my husband is from Utah) my mom sometimes sends me the packs but now i will just do it by myself ;) :) Reply Delete Replies Kristy Sayer December 24, 2012 at 1:29 PM The packs are definitely convenient, but I love making a healthier version at home which I can adapt to add anything I feel like!

Here is my latest offering \u2013 a deliciously moist and caramely butterscotch pudding that\u2019s ready in under five minutes. You\u2019ll need: 1 large mug 1 1/2 tbs milk 2 tsp butter 2 tbs brown sugar 1 tsp honey 3 tbs self-raising flour 1/4 tsp cinnamon 2 1/2 tbs hot water Microwave milk and butter in mug for about 30 seconds or until butter is mostly melted. Add half the brown sugar and microwave again for about 15 seconds then stir until the sugar has dissolved. Mix in the honey and self raising flour until the batter is smooth. Sprinkle the remaining brown sugar and cinnamon over the batter then gently pour the hot water on top. Microwave on high for 60-75 seconds until spongey on top and saucy underneath, then stand for 1-2 minutes. Serve with a dollop of cream or ice-cream. You can thank me later.

Do you know what temperature it would be set for? This looks very yummy. Pamela Reply melbournemummy says: on June 13, 2013 at 3:01 am You could probably make it in a ramekin in the oven but I haven\u2019t made it that way myself. I\u2019d guess that 10-12 minutes at around 180C (355F) would do the trick. I\u2019d check it at intervals and take it out when the top looks spongey. Let me know how you go!

Reply Tia Sabs says: on July 20, 2015 at 4:19 am Made this but the texture was nothing like pudding. It was all set up. Tasted fine albeit a little too sweet but splattered my microwave and left a huge cleanup \ud83d\ude26 Wonder what I did wrong\u2026 Reply melbournemummy says: on July 20, 2015 at 6:39 am Hi Tia, where are you from? In Australia a pudding is usually a moist type of cake with sauce that you bake in the oven. If you found it too sweet you might prefer the chocolate mug cake next time. Make sure you use a large mug, and if your microwave is powerful reduce the cooking time or monitor closely to avoid splatters. Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

I like dessert and I like it a whole lot. It feels nice to have a special little treat sometimes. I look forward to it, I savour it and I enjoy it during a quiet time when I am relaxed and am winding down for the day. But it wasn\u2019t always like this. Prior to becoming paleo eating dessert used to be followed by mass waves of guilt, shame and self loathing or I felt the need to justify eating it by telling myself that I \u2018deserved\u2019 it as I had been so strict on my diet for 2 weeks beforehand. I was always left wanting more and if left to my own devices found it difficult to stop. To add to these feelings I also suffered bloating and bad skin afterwards. But paleo desserts are different. They are friendly to your insides, don\u2019t leave you suffering from bloating and bad skin, taste amazing yet aren\u2019t packed full of sugar so you feel satisfied afterwards and there is no fear that it is going to increase those dreaded numbers on the scale. So I thought I would share with you my favourite little pink paleo treat that I like to whip up for myself. Raspberry Mousse serves one 2 tablespoons of chia seeds 2 tablespoons of raspberries, frozen or fresh 1 teaspoon of raw honey or stevia granules \u00bd teaspoon of lemon zest, finely grated 2 tablespoons of boiling water 4 tablespoons of the thick coconut cream from a pre-refrigerated can In a teacup or small jar mix together the chia seeds, raspberries, honey or stevia and the lemon zest. Add the boiling water, give it all a good stir and then let it sit for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes the chia seeds should have plumped up and soaked in most of the water. Now stir in the chilled coconut cream until everything is completely combined. You can either eat straight away or pop it back in the fridge for 20 minutes to thicken a little more.

Welcome to my blog. I write about food, motherhood and all that makes up our days. Apples Under My Bed Nov 5 Nov  5  Banana Soft Serve with Toasted Seeds and Nut Butter Topping Heidi Apples Food & Cooking Good morning, friends. Monday afternoon I posted a picture on my instagram account  of a rather extravagant snack. It involved banana soft serve, nut butter, maple syrup and sea salt. Many appeared to appreciate my concoction and Carly  asked for a recipe, so today I decided to wake a bit earlier, update my previous mention  of banana soft serve and scribe a recipe for Wednesday Breakfast Club . Banana soft serve - what is that ? Well it's really just pureed frozen bananas, maybe with a dash of milk or yoghurt to help move things along. That's it . Banana soft serve (I hesitate to call it ice-cream as though it is creamy in texture it does tend to melt quickly like a soft serve) is outrageously simple and tasty, and after trying it once you'll surely insist on having bags of chopped, frozen bananas in your freezer at all times. For breakfast today, I bedazzled my banana soft serve good and proper with toasted seeds and melted nut butter. Smooth banana cream with rich and sticky nut butter, slightly crunchy flaxmeal and certainly crunchy seeds, plus the sweet pop of syrup and salt. Oh, it was a treat. Banana Soft Serve with Toasted Seeds and Nut Butter Topping Serves one Ingredients 1 frozen Banana 2-3 tablespoons Milk (any kind, eg: cow's or almond) 1 tablespoon Nut Butter (I used a blend of roasted almonds and cashews, similar to this recipe ) 1 tablespoon Sunflower Seeds and Pepitas 1 tablespoon Flaxmeal (ground flax seeds, or LSA mix) 1 teaspoon Pure Maple Syrup Sea Salt Method 1. Toast the seeds in a non-stick pan over low heat for a few minutes until nice and toasty and slightly golden. Set aside. 2. If you nut butter is not drippy, melt it in a small saucepan over low heat, thinning with a tablespoon of milk and whisking as required. Set aside. 3. Puree the frozen banana in a food processor (adding 1-2 tablespoons milk as required) until smooth. 4. Spoon the banana soft serve mixture into a bowl and top with the flaxmeal, nut butter, seeds, maple syrup and a sprinkle of sea salt. Happy soft serve Wednesday!

Pick your favorite frozen fruits, blend and enjoy! I love getting soft serve and frozen yogurt from fancy shops, but sometimes the cravings come on fast and furious at home, especially after we take the dog for a walk or spend some time outside. I created this recipe one night when I opened the freezer to search for something sweet and cold and found myself facing a giant bag of frozen strawberries. Along with the frozen strawberries, I grabbed some frozen raspberries and took out my blender, determined to make a cold and creamy dessert. I also had a can of coconut milk in the pantry and decided to give it a try, and the end result was a fantastic bowl of strawberry coconut soft serve! Save Print Strawberry Coconut Soft Serve Prep time: 5 mins Total time: 5 mins Serves: 1 This sweet frozen treat is perfect when you need a quick and healthy dessert but don't want to go out to a fancy frozen yogurt shop. Pick your favorite frozen fruits, blend and enjoy! Ingredients 1 cup frozen strawberries \u00bc cup raspberries \u00bc cup light coconut milk (plus more, if needed, to get everything moving) Tiny splash coconut extract Shredded coconut for garnish Instructions Combine strawberries, raspberries and coconut milk in a high-powered blender or food processor. Blend until smooth and creamy (several minutes). Add coconut extract to taste. (Note: Start with a very small amount and increase gradually. Coconut extract is very strong!) Scoop soft serve into a bowl and garnish with shredded coconut. 3.5.3226 If you are a banana-lover, feel free to add half of a frozen banana (and likely a little more coconut milk) to the mix to make the soft serve even creamier! And if you\u2019d rather not use coconut milk, you can easily use almond, soy or regular milk in its place, but, if you choose to do this, I would definitely add half of a frozen banana to keep the soft serve nice and creamy.

Over the course of the past half decade, I\u2019ve witnessed Thom eat his fair share of baked goods \u2013 and in the process I discovered that sometimes\u00a0all he needs is a single serving of chocolate chip cookies because the man has no self control when cookies are involved.\u00a0And if you leave an entire batch at his disposal, he\u2019ll eat them all and ask you to make more.\u00a0Then he\u2019ll eat those, too, and complain about his stomach aching and you\u2019ll decide it\u2019s time to start developing small batch recipes.\u00a0So if your favorite person is like Thom, surely they\u2019ll appreciate these recipes.\u00a0And so will you because they can be thrown together without having to dirty heavy mixing machines or three baking sheets or every single measuring device you own. my favorite man The recipes, they\u2019re good. Straight forward and equally as delicious as a full batch, but without all of the elbow grease required to scoop 36 cookies or roll out a 10\u2033 pie crust. The selling point, for me, is that small batch recipes don\u2019t produce any waste. Not\u00a0that anything really goes to waste around here because I\u2019m the lady who shows up at my neighbor\u2019s door at 10 o\u2019clock at night, begging her to take a container of brownies away because Bad things will happen if you don\u2019t. \u00a0The other selling point is the expression on Thom\u2019s face when he realizes I\u2019ve made something special just for him. Friends, I\u2019ve been saying it for years: the best way to a man\u2019s heart is, without a doubt, through his stomach. Notes:\u00a0If you prefer a sweeter pie crust, feel free to increase the sugar to one full teaspoon. But I promise you won\u2019t require it if you fill the pie with the full 6 teaspoons (2 tablespoons) of sugar. This recipe requires the use of one deep dish 4\u2033 tartlet pan (although I suppose a ramekin would work, as well). I got my tartlet pans in a set at , but if you like getting ripped off, you can get them individually at Williams-Sonoma (my least favorite kitchen store in the history of kitchen stores) (look at the price difference per tart pan \u2013 $5.66). Greedy asswads. Sur la Table SINGLE SERVING DEEP DISH APPLE PIE Crust 1/2 cup unbleached flour 1/2 tsp cane sugar Pinch of fine sea salt 3 tbsp vegan butter , cold 2-3 tbsp water , ice cold Filling 4-6 tsp cane sugar 1 tsp potato starch 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon One medium apple , peeled and chopped 1/2 tsp lemon juice , optional Preheat oven to 350\u02daF. Lightly oil a 4\u2033 deep dish tart pan; set aside. In a small mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, and salt. Cut in the butter, using a pastry cutter or two knives, until the mixture resembles coarse meal with a few larger chunks. Add two tablespoons of the water and mix with fingers until a smooth dough forms. If the dough feels a little dry, add a bit more water. Knead the dough for 1-2 minutes then wrap with plastic and let rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. To make the filling, stir together the sugar (I used 5 teaspoons), starch, and cinnamon. Add the apples and lemon juice; toss to coat and set aside. Line a flat surface with parchment paper and sprinkle with flour. Roll the dough into a circle about 1/4\u2033 thick. Fit to prepared tart pan, making sure it\u2019s pressed into the bottom into the scalloped edges. Roll a rolling pin over the top of the pan to remove the excess dough. Fill with apples. Roll the remaining dough scraps, cut with a mini heart shaped cookie cutter (dip in flour if sticking to dough), and arrange on top of pie. Brush with a bit of soy milk and sprinkle with sugar, if desired. Bake at 350\u02daF for 35-40 minutes (if you notice the hearts starting to brown, put a piece of tin foil over top of them after about 25 minutes). Let cool for 10 minutes then serve. Can be refrigerated in an air tight container for up to two days. If you\u2019d prefer to assemble the pie and save it for later, remove the pie from the freezer when ready to bake and let it thaw for about 20 minutes. Follow baking instructions above. Unbaked pie will keep frozen for up to 6 weeks in an air tight, freezer proof container. Yield: 1 4\u2033 pie 45 Comments Share: 45 Comments Reply Taylor 7 May 2013 at 1:36 PM So cute!

Yes\u2013I agree with Taylor, only problem is that I would totally need to make one for myself, haha. Also, so intrigued why you dislike SLT?!  I generally prefer it over W-S, because I find W-S is more of a rip off most of the time.  But I agree, in this case, I can understand why! Reply thejollyfox.com 10 May 2013 at 10:49 PM That\u2019s funny\u2013I was thinking the same thing. I prefer WS over SLT, but find that on a general level, WS costs more than SLT.

(For your shopping convenience, this post contains affiliate links.) Yep, you can make this easy single serving Blueberry Cobbler  recipe in ONE MINUTE!!\u00a0 And it was quite tasty if I do say so myself!\u00a0 Thumbs up from the family and they\u2019ve actually been requesting these simple blueberry cobblers on a regular basis now. You do need a few minutes to prepare these cobblers, but each blueberry cobbler only takes one minute to cook in the microwave.\u00a0 These single serving berry cobblers are perfect to make if you only want to make one or two servings instead of making\u00a0a huge pan in the oven. These single serving cobblers are also\u00a0great if you have a late night craving and need something quick! I cut way back on the sugar and used simple ingredients but I bet you won\u2019t miss it all! If blueberry isn\u2019t your thing, I also have a recipes for Individual Strawberry Cobblers \u00a0and Amaretto Caramel Apple Mug Cobblers . Instead of blueberries you could also try different fruit in this recipe. This easy blueberry cobbler recipe comes\u00a0together quick! These are meant to be an easy QUICK fix if you\u2019re craving something sweet. No, it\u2019s NOT\u00a0just as good as a big sugary gooey blueberry cobbler out of the oven that took all day to make (so don\u2019t send me nasty emails\u2026), but it\u2019s still tasty especially with a little ice cream or whipped cream on top. First, mix together all the dry ingredients, flour, sugar, and baking powder.\u00a0 Add a pinch of salt if you\u2019d like. You could add a little cinnamon or spices. Then mix in your milk and melted butter to the batter. Place your blueberries in the bottom of your ramekin.\u00a0 You\u2019ll need a large ramekin  (8 oz.).\u00a0You could also substitute a large microwave safe mug  or small bowl. This would work well like a mug cake recipe. I did not add any sugar to my blueberries, but if you like your blueberry cobblers really sweet add a little sugar or even maple syrup. You could also add a little cornstarch or flour if you want the fruit juices to thicken up.\u00a0 I really didn\u2019t think it needed it. Press down on your blueberries a little with the back of a spoon or fork to make room for the topping. For a little extra flavor you could add a little vanilla extract, almond extract, or even maple extract. Spoon your cobbler topping on top of the blueberries in a nice even layer. Place the ramekin on top of a small microwave safe plate JUST in case the blueberries boil over a little.\u00a0 Sometimes mine do, sometimes they don\u2019t. Microwave the blueberry cobbler on high for 30 seconds, check on it, then microwave another 30 seconds. You may have to adjust the time slightly for your particular microwave.\u00a0 Microwaving for 2 intervals of 30 seconds seemed to help prevent the blueberries from boiling over too much by giving them just enough time to cool down slightly. Top with your favorite ice cream , whipped topping, or whipped cream if you\u2019d like. And there you go, an easy single serving microwave blueberry cobbler ready in no time. Wasn\u2019t that quick and easy for a fresh blueberry cobbler?\u00a0 Only 6 ingredients, a few minutes to prep, and 1 minute in the microwave for a quick and easy single serving blueberry cobbler!!! This easy blueberry cobbler recipe is the perfect quick sugar fix! Great in the summer when fresh blueberries are abundant. Here\u2019s a quick video to show how fast these cobblers are to put together\u2026 You could also try defrosted frozen berries if you don\u2019t want to wait until summer! I hope you enjoy these cute mini blueberry cobblers! Thanks for visiting! 3.84  from 6  votes Print One Minute Blueberry Cobbler Quick and easy blueberry cobbler recipe that can be made in just 1 minute! Course Dessert Cuisine American Prep Time 5 minutes Cook Time 1 minute Total Time 6 minutes Yield 1 Author Snappy Gourmet - Lisa Huff Ingredients 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons sugar 1/4 teaspoon baking powder pinch of salt 2 tablespoons milk 2 teaspoons unsalted butter melted 1/2 cup fresh blueberries Toppings (optional): ice cream, whipped topping, or whipped cream Instructions In a small bowl, mix together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt until well combined. Mix in milk and melted butter until just combined. Place blueberries in bottom of a large (8 oz.) microwave safe ramekin or microwave safe mug. Press blueberries down slightly with the back of a fork to break up. Spoon batter on top of blueberries. Place cobbler on top of small microwave safe plate in case blueberries boil over. Microwave on high for 30 seconds, check on cobbler, then microwave another 30 seconds. Adjust baking time as needed for your microwave. Top with your favorite ice cream, whipped topping, or whipped cream if desired. Recipe Notes SNAPPY TIPS: I have only made these cobblers 1 at a time in the microwave. You can make multiple cobblers at a time but will need to adjust cooking time. Do not overfill your ramekin/mug or it will boil over a lot. For a little more flavor add a little vanilla extract, almond extract, or other flavoring to the topping or fruit. SNAPPY SUBSTITUTIONS: Instead of blueberries, try other fruit but some fruit may need to be precooked. You can also add a little sugar or maple syrup to the blueberries or add a little flour or cornstarch if you want the juices to thicken up. You can also add cinnamon or other spices to your cobbler topping or blueberries.

Reply Lisa Huff says August 25, 2016 at 10:33 am I have done that before but I don\u2019t see why not. I would maybe just bring it to room temperature first or it may need a little more cooking. Reply Paulette Straub says March 21, 2017 at 9:46 am Could I use Splenda instead of sugar?? If so how many packets would I use? Reply Lisa Huff says March 22, 2017 at 10:13 am I\u2019m sure you could use a sugar substitute, but I have not tried it so can\u2019t guarantee the results. I would check on the Splenda packets and see what the sugar equivalent is. Reply Michi I'Lundaria says April 4, 2017 at 8:47 pm Just made this tonight and I cant say thank you enough!

The texture was not good\u2026..I ate the blueberries and chunked the rest. Think it definitely needs more butter. Reply Lisa Huff says June 3, 2017 at 4:52 pm Sorry to hear you didn\u2019t enjoy. Unfortunately, microwaves can vary so very easy to overcook. Reply heather says June 5, 2017 at 12:40 pm is there something else I can use in the milks place? Reply Lisa Huff says June 11, 2017 at 9:44 pm You could try a milk substitute like almond milk or coconut milk but I have not tried so can\u2019t guarantee how it will turn out.

This shop is part of a social shopper marketing insight campaign with Pollinate Media Group\u00ae and Del Monte, but all my opinions are my own. #pmedia #DelMonteBTS http://my-disclosur.es/OBsstV School has begun and summer is officially over. I\u2019m always a little sad to see summer go, because I love the warm weather. \u00a0However, this particular summer was nuts. \u00a0Crazy. \u00a0Absolute chaos. \u00a0I\u2019m kind of grateful to have a few hours of silence. On the other hand, this school year is different than all the others. \u00a0My oldest son, The Lizard, is a senior this year. \u00a0It\u2019s his very last year of school. \u00a0It makes me a little teary, and frankly, nostalgic for the first day of kindergarten. We\u2019re in the final stretch now, the last year of teaching this kid to be an adult. \u00a0I\u2019ve got to be sure he can make his bed, and pay his bills, and feed himself. \u00a0Something besides ramen noodles and cold cereal, preferably. Since I had to go to Walmart for new lunch boxes this year, I decided to get some healthy lunch foods for my nearly-grown, and always-hungry kiddos while I was there. \u00a0These diced peach cups from were perfect. Del Monte They are great with a sandwich and some pretzel sticks. They are also the perfect size to make a little dessert for one, so I got The Lizard to help me throw it together. \u00a0I don\u2019t want The Lizard eating candy bars for dessert after he leaves home. \u00a0Not when this crispy peach cobbler is so easy to make, so warm, comforting, and delicious. I started with a little peach cup, added some oats, brown sugar and butter, and voila! \u00a0Dessert. \u00a0REAL dessert. If you hurry, you can find a great deal at Walmart on these Del Monte fruit cups. \u00a0Create some\u00a0back to school memories by getting a free back to school photo print at participating Walmart Super Centers, and receive a $1 off coupon for Del Monte products. Here are the details: From August 1 \u2013 September 13, 2014, Walmart Print Shops are offering a free back to school photo, while supplies last. \u00a0When you pick up your back to school print, you will receive a coupon for $1 off the purchase of (2) Del Monte 4-pack fruit cups or (2) Fruit Burst Squeezers, while supplies last. I love a snack food that works as part of a healthy breakfast or lunch, an after school snack, or a tasty dessert! Maybe it will even help take the sting out of this final year of high school.

Never thought you'd here cold  and African  in the same sentence, huh? Me neither until we got here\u2026 The morning get pretty chilly! 40's-50's for sure. Great sweatshirt and fuzzy socks weather;) I forced my self to  run this morning\u2026 You know, it's really not easy getting out of bed when you- for some odd reason, wake up at 6:15 and you hear the pretty little birdies outside your window singing their little songs and it's super cold. But I did it. And I felt really good after I ran. It's just the getting-out-the-door part that nearly kills me. So after I took my shower and got all freshened up, I decided to reward myself with a somewhat healthy and stinking delicious breakfast. The recipe that I used actually said to put it in the oven for 30 minutes\u2026 I was like \"YAH RIGHT!\" so I decided to microwave it instead, and it worked perfectly perfect. P.S. How ADORABLE is that little \"Le Creuset\" wanna-be? I got that at one of my favorite stores \"Mr. Price\"\u2026 Let me tell you, that store is a little bit of heaven for me. When you walk in there you most definitely would have no idea you were in Africa. The store is filled with loads of cute bedding {I got most of the things that are in my room from there}, other house stuff, and lots and lots of dishes. I got A LOT there for only about $15! :) Talk about getting side-tracked\u2026 APPLE CRISP! Ahh it was so good! When I set it down and took the lid off, it filled my room with the most amazing aroma ever. Apple-y, cinnamon-y, caramel-y goodness! Single Serving Apple Crisp 1 small apple 2 tbsp. brown sugar 2 tbsp. oats 1 1/2 tbsp. flour 1/4 tsp. cinnamon 1 tbsp. butter Thinly slice the apple and place in a mixing bowl. Add 1 tbsp. brown sugar, 1/2 tbsp. flour, and 1/8 tsp. cinnamon. Coat the apples with the dry ingredients and place in a small baking dish. Mix together the rest of the dry ingredients and the butter; put on top of the apples. Microwave for 60-90 seconds. Check out some other single serving recipes!

This is a little cup of pumpkin pie, mug cake-style, with a gingersnap crust and snappy spices, and it feeds just one person: you. Make it in a mug, in the microwave, and you can be eating pumpkin pie 10 minutes from right now. Yes, this is a mug pie (not to be confused with a mudpie ) but it falls somewhere between a pie and a cake in texture. It's a little treat for those of you who adore pumpkin and spiced fall desserts, and it's a quick and easy way to give yourself a sweet ending to a long day without baking an entire pie. Like other mug cakes baked in the microwave, its texture is soft and a little spongy. There's a satisfying base of gingersnap crumbs in butter, too; they don't crisp up like they would in the oven but I love the way they complement the taste of the pumpkin. The pumpkin comes through boldly; if you have homemade squash puree lying about this is a great use for it. I sweeten it up with brown sugar and spice it with pumpkin pie spice, but feel free to substitute honey, maple syrup, or other sweeteners, and to use your own mixes of spices instead of a packaged pumpkin pie spice. (Image credit: Faith Durand ) More Mug Cakes Oatmeal Nutella Mug Cake 13 Easy Microwave Mug Cakes That Are All Grown Up Mug-Cake Pumpkin Pie: Watch the Video Pumpkin Pie Mug Cake Makes 1 1 teaspoon unsalted butter 14 grams gingersnaps (2 small cookies), crushed into 2 tablespoons of crumbs 1/3 cup pumpkin puree 1 large egg 1 tablespoon milk or cream 2 tablespoons brown sugar 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice Place the butter in a microwave-safe mug that holds at least 10 ounces, and microwave on LOW until melted. Stir in the crushed gingersnaps and press the mixture firmly into the bottom of the mug. In a separate small bowl, whisk together the pumpkin puree, egg, milk or cream, brown sugar, and pumpkin pie spice. Pour into mug with the gingersnap \"crust.\" Place the mug on a microwave-safe plate. Microwave on full power for 2 to 5 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the center of the mug pie comes out clean. The top may look slightly damp but it will set as it cools. (Cooking time will vary greatly depending on your microwave and the width and depth of the mug. Start with 2 minutes and continue cooking in 30-second increments until it is done.) Use a hot pad or oven mitt to carefully remove the mug from the microwave. Let it stand for a couple minutes to cool, then top, if desired, with whipped cream and crushed nuts before eating. Recipe Notes Doubling the recipe:  You can double this recipe, but only cook one mug pie in the microwave at a time.

Blog \u00bb Single-Serving Pumpkin Cinnamon Rolls Single-Serving Pumpkin Cinnamon Rolls Posted by immaeatthat September 10, 2014 Featured in: The Garden Jump to recipe Looking for a small batch recipe to do some fall baking? Try this single serving cinnamon roll made with pumpkin. by Kylie Mitchell It\u2019s pumpkin time again (\"insert pumpkin emoji here\u201d)!! I really want to incorporate more savory pumpkin things into my life this fall.\u00a0 It\u2019s not gonna be all pumpkin muffins , pumpkin scones  and pumpkin pancakes  for me.\u00a0 No, this year I\u2019m going to branch out.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been dreaming of pumpkin gnocchi with arugula for like 3 weeks now.\u00a0 But before I go all savory pumpkin, I had to go sweet pumpkin. I make pumpkin breakfast bakes  all year round.\u00a0 Pumpkin puree does something to the texture of breakfast bakes that nothing else can.\u00a0 Other than breakfast bakes, I save all baked pumpkin goods for September thru December.\u00a0 That way they seem like something special around the holidays. I\u2019m not sure when, but at some point in my life I stopped carving pumpkins and started eating them.\u00a0 Is this a life change everyone goes through?\u00a0 I never remember eating the vegetable when I was a kid.\u00a0 Even during the holidays I didn\u2019t touch pumpkin pie because there was always something chocolaty that I preferred.\u00a0 But at some defining moment I realized the wonder pumpkin can add to one's life. I took one bite of these pumpkin cinnamon rolls to taste test them and then I ummm\u2026ate them all.\u00a0 I should\u2019ve known this would happen.\u00a0 I have rather limited self-control with cinnamon rolls.\u00a0 They are easily my favorite baked good ever.\u00a0 Layers of dough + layers of cinnamon-sugar.\u00a0 Hello, beautiful.\u00a0 It\u2019s like the most perfect thing ever.\u00a0 And now we\u2019ve added pumpkin to those layers, so all you pumpkin spice latte lovers out there should definitely get behind this. I never order cinnamon rolls when I\u2019m at a restaurant because you can\u2019t control the gooeyness.\u00a0 I\u2019m a big advocate for gooey things. True story: I ordered a cinnamon roll at Disneyland when I was little and it was like the worst experience of my life.\u00a0 It should have been the best cinnamon roll ever since, ya know, DISNEY!\u00a0 But then I tasted it and it was flaky and dry like a crossiant and not ooey and gooey like my favorite thing.\u00a0 Ugh such a let down.\u00a0 I think that was probably the last cinnamon roll I ordered out.\u00a0 I learned my lesson.\u00a0 If Disney can't get it right...no one can. Now I really do love making homemade cinnamon rolls.\u00a0 I do I do I do.\u00a0 I love sprinkling on the filling, rolling up the dough into that classic cinnamon roll shape and slicing up the dough into little, fluffy rolls.\u00a0 I do not however like waiting for cinnamon rolls to rise.\u00a0 That is why I went the yeast-free route for this single-serving pumpkin version. We should address the fact that these pumpkin cinnamon rolls are only loosely sticking to the Global Garden theme.\u00a0 Pumpkin is the only ingredient in this recipe that grows in a garden.\u00a0 But it\u2019s almost fall, which is reason for pumpkin-infused celebration, ya know? If you think making a single-serving cinnamon roll seems like the most selfish thing ever, you could always double the recipe.\u00a0 And I will come eat it with you.\u00a0 And we will be best friends. Single-serving Pumpkin Cinnamon Rolls Yield Serves 1 (makes 2 baby cinnamon rolls) Ingredients Dough: 1/4 cup oat flour, packed 1/4 cup whole wheat flour 1/4 teaspoon baking powder 1/8 teaspoon baking soda 3-1/2 tablespoons pumpkin puree 1 tablespoon butter, softened 1/4 teaspoon vanilla Filling: 2 teaspoons brown sugar 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon 1 scant teaspoon butter, softened Icing: Greek yogurt honey Directions Preheat oven to 350F.\u00a0 In a bowl, combine oat flour, whole wheat flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt.\u00a0 Add in pumpkin puree, butter and vanilla.\u00a0\u00a0 Use a spoon (or your hands) to combine until a dough forms. In a separate bowl, combine brown sugar and cinnamon. Lightly flour a flat surface.\u00a0 Roll dough into a ball.\u00a0 Now roll dough back and forth between your hands to make a long cylinder of dough.\u00a0 Place the dough onto the floured surface and press flat.\u00a0 Spread butter over the top and sprinkle on the brown sugar-cinnamon.\u00a0 Roll dough up into a cinnamon roll shape and cut roll in half to make two cinnamon rolls.\u00a0 Place the cinnamon rolls into a greased ramekin.\u00a0 Bake for 12 minutes for gooey cinnamon rolls or 16 minutes for fully cooked cinnamon rolls.\u00a0 Stir together greek yogurt and honey.\u00a0 Drizzle over the top.

For a while I\u2019ve been trying to come up with a quick and easy way to make an individual serving of brownie a la mode at home, and the results aren\u2019t always the best.\u00a0\u00a0 Some have turned out like this\u2026 We\u2019ll call those Brownie A La Garbage Disposal.\u00a0 Bleh.\u00a0\u00a0 I tried using mixes, thinking that would be a nice way to keep it easy, but I was never happy with the results.\u00a0 Today I decided to work on one based on my favorite brownie recipe  and see what I could create, and I think we have a winner. Yeah, this recipe is a keeper.\u00a0\u00a0 Hot, gooey, dark chocolatey brownies in a few short minutes using the microwave and simple ingredients???\u00a0\u00a0 We\u2019ll call them Brownies A La Anytime. Here is what you need\u2026 At the very last moment I decided that I wanted to add baking powder, so this guy didn\u2019t make it into the photo, but he made it into the brownies.\u00a0\u00a0 The ingredients are as follows.\u00a0 This will make one generous serving.\u00a0\u00a0 It could be shared, if you are feeling generous, but I won\u2019t judge you if you keep it all to yourself. Brownies A La Anytime 4 Tablespoons Flour 3 Tablespoons Sugar Pinch Of Salt 1/8 teaspoon Baking Powder 2 Tablespoons Cocoa Powder (I prefer Hershey\u2019s Dark Cocoa Powder) 1 Tablespoon Melted Butter 1-2 Tablespoons Oil (such as vegetable, canola or coconut) 1 Tablespoon Water 1/4 Teaspoon Vanilla You can top with a few chocolate chips or nuts if you like. Melt your butter in a microwave safe bowl or cup (took me about 12 seconds).\u00a0\u00a0 Add the oil to your melted butter and mix well. If you want a moister brownie, go for the full two tablespoons.\u00a0 I prefer a really solid, dense brownie (which I top with ice cream adding a lot of moisture) so I use one tablespoon of oil.  \u00a0 Add in your vanilla and water, stir well to combine.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In a separate bowl or cup, combine all dry ingredients. As I said, I used only one tablespoon of oil, so my mix is a bit on the drier/firm side.\u00a0\u00a0 I pressed it into my ramekin.\u00a0\u00a0 You could also use a mug, microwaving things in a mug seems to be the popular thing, but being a non-coffee drinker (hello, Diet Coke!), I have more ramekins than I do mugs. I added a few chocolate chips to the top. I started with 45 seconds in the microwave and ended up cooking mine for about one minute and ten seconds.\u00a0 That\u2019s 70 seconds people \u2013 until hot, gooey, delicious, dark, sweet chocolate goodness.\u00a0\u00a0 SEVENTY SECONDS!\u00a0\u00a0 That\u2019s like magic! Instant.\u00a0 Gratification.\u00a0\u00a0 Which is both a very good, and possibly very bad, thing.\u00a0\u00a0 These may be too easy to whip up! In my opinion, anything \u201ca la mode\u201d needs ice cream.\u00a0 End of story. These are best enjoyed within a few minutes of heating them up.\u00a0\u00a0 I have a few yummy variations coming up, but I have to pace myself, eating four of these in a day is probably not recommended.\u00a0 Though it would be damn delicious.\u00a0\u00a0 ENJOY!

Reply debzy says July 14, 2012 at 9:40 pm that is pure genius! Reply ThisBakerGirlBlogs says July 15, 2012 at 1:07 am So much gooey goodness! So easy aswell, will definitely try this out \ud83d\ude42 Reply Katrina @ Warm Vanilla Sugar says July 15, 2012 at 4:13 am Mmm such a great idea!! Sometimes brownies are needed for one\u2026and now I have a recipe! Reply Olivia says July 15, 2012 at 6:32 am Oh man\u2026this recipe just made my day. Which just started. Would it be weird to make this immediately after breakfast? \ud83d\ude09 Reply Hayley @ The Domestic Rebel says July 15, 2012 at 8:03 am You\u2019re right\u2013these are good and bad. Good because I love knowing I don\u2019t need to whip up a huge batch when I have a brownie craving attack, but bad knowing how quick and easy they are to indulge in a couple ramekins-ful! Reply marla says July 15, 2012 at 8:19 am You are a genius with the sweet treats!! This looks great! Reply Averie @ Averie Cooks says July 15, 2012 at 12:38 pm Christi it looks so delish! Saw it on FG, too. Congrats \u2013 I want to reach into the screen and grab some! Reply Natasha says July 15, 2012 at 5:39 pm I love this! Totally making it tonight! Thanks for sharing \ud83d\ude42 Reply steph says July 15, 2012 at 5:46 pm amazing!!!! tried these tonight with chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream. awesome! also \u2013 i was out of cocoa powder, so as a sub i used dark hot chocolate mix and omitted the sugar. turned out great!!! Reply Lari says July 16, 2012 at 2:14 am Hey\u2026 That sounds perfect\u2026 Unfortunately I don\u2019t have a microwave, does this also work in a normal oven? XX Lari Cent4urThoughts.blogspot.com Reply linsey says July 19, 2012 at 9:20 am I tried this delicious looking treat and followed the instructions exactly, but sadly, they turned out completely disgusting! Unfortunately for me, it didn\u2019t really taste like a brownie at all. I mean, it looked just like the brownie you have pictured, it just didn\u2019t taste the way you described it. So I guess I won\u2019t be trying that recipie again \ud83d\ude41 Reply Sam says July 27, 2012 at 10:06 am You are a genius! Although microwave brownies may be dangerous in my hands\u2026 too easy!! Cant wait to make (and eat!) xx Reply Tami says July 29, 2012 at 5:24 pm Saw this at dinner time. Ended up making this instead of dinner! Good thing I didn\u2019t have to cook for anyone tonight!! Added peanut butter chips and chopped pecans. Delicious!! Dangerously good and easy! Reply Christi says July 29, 2012 at 6:19 pm Tami, your version sounds delish! Dinner is SO overrated. \ud83d\ude42 Reply Sam says August 1, 2012 at 10:26 am I made this the other day and I loved it so much I made many more batches of the dry ingredients so I only have to pull out a baggie and cook! I used 2 Tbsp of oil because I wanted mine super moist. Also, next time I am going to use less cocoa powder since these are super rich. (Needless to say, I did not use any extra chocolate chips!) I made mine all in the same mug to create less dishes and topped it with mint chocolate chip ice cream! It was fantastic! And it was a hit at the office too! Reply Jasmine says August 12, 2012 at 6:16 am That looks amazing! Mmmm\u2026\u2026 But if I wanted to make 3 servings, let\u2019s say, do I triple the ingredients? Thanks for sharing this recipe, your recipes are always so creative! Reply Hanna says September 9, 2012 at 3:50 pm Made it in a mug and left it for about 20 min, when I came back it was rock solid\u2026. it was still delicious! Reply Precious says September 22, 2012 at 8:01 pm 1st WOW can\u2019t wait to try these & the chocolate chip a la mode. 2nd I\u2019m not a dark chocolate person so I wanted to know why do you prefer the dark chocolate? Reply Christi says September 23, 2012 at 10:31 am Precious, I just prefer the taste of dark chocolate. I\u2019m not a milk chocolate person, so just a matter of personal taste. \ud83d\ude42 Reply Katie says October 3, 2012 at 8:38 pm Just made these in my waffle iron\u2026 TO.DIE.FOR!!! Reply Christi says October 5, 2012 at 11:41 am Katie, in the waffle iron??? Oh I HAVE to try that. Can we then justify them as a breakfast food? I say yes\u2026 Reply Alison says October 25, 2012 at 7:38 pm So tonight I was randomly surfing facebook and a former co-worker that I haven\u2019t had even a brief conversation with in over 5 years had posted about her wish for an on-hand baker to satisfy her spur-of-the-moment brownie cravings. I linked her to this post, and 10 minutes later she called me up and said I was \u201cthe bomb!\u201d and then jokingly cursed me for showing her to your baking blog because of all the weight she\u2019ll gain trying out your yummy recipes! I haven\u2019t been told I\u2019m \u201cthe bomb\u201d, well, ever. Made my night! Thanks for sharing awesome recipes that make us all look good! Reply Christi says October 25, 2012 at 9:33 pm Alison, thanks for sharing that great story! \ud83d\ude42 Reply Rachel says December 3, 2012 at 6:32 pm Found this on Pinterest, made it right away, and love it! I topped mine with a few vanilla chips and a few mint chocolate chips. Thank you! Reply Stephanie says January 21, 2013 at 10:34 pm Made these tonight for my boyfriend & I. Tried one with coconut oil and the other with vegetable oil\u2026 the first came out looking ugly & a little dry, but after adding a little heavy whipping cream to it, it was pretty good, but sort of lacking in sweet-ness. The second came out looking just like yours (I was very excited!), but it was dry inside and tasted a little floury\u2026 maybe a difference in microwaves caused this? Also, I used unsweetened cocoa. Overall, I was glad I tried it out. The recipe was quick and fun to make, maybe I\u2019ll try some variations in the prep some other time! Thanks \ud83d\ude42 Reply Fatema says January 29, 2013 at 11:39 am Hey I tried this recipe of yours tonight and they turned out great except they dried up in the microwave. BUT ended up tasting like a great batch of chocolate cookies! Heh. Also I wanted them super moist but 2 tablespoons of oil didnt help. They were too crumbly. Any tips on how to get them to be a little more perfect the next time I make the brownies? \ud83d\ude00 Reply Courtney says March 7, 2013 at 5:07 pm just made 2 of these\u2026 they were awesome! had to cook them 5 seconds longer, but it was great! drizzled a little caramel on top before i cooked them. Reply Jasmine says April 7, 2013 at 1:21 pm Wonderful! The cake is a tad bit bland to me. I should\u2019ve added some coffee powder or something. Anyhow, it was great! I had this, topped with m&ms, whipped cream, and chocolate syrup! Hey, I\u2019m on my period! Reply Daisy says April 24, 2013 at 3:39 pm I owe you some serious kudos for this!! I\u2019m in the middle of revision time and just made this. 60 secs @ 800Watt. Chucked some evaporated milk over it which I had in the cupboard. Just sublime. Thank you! Daisy Reply Penny says May 15, 2013 at 9:59 pm One more thing to do to make the prep minutes/seconds even shorter. MIX in the baking dish! I mixed my dry ingredients in a bowl, melted my butter in the baking dish added the other liquid ingredients and then added the bowl of dry ingredients! Less clean up too! Reply Naeva says May 19, 2013 at 9:28 am Screw self control, I\u2019m going to eat all of this. When I was making the brownie, I dissolved the sugar in the wet ingredients to make sure there would be no graininess\u2026I\u2019m not saying there were, but many single serve recipies I have tried came out sandy. This is by far the best single serve brownie recipe I have ever done. Thank you!! Reply Christi says May 19, 2013 at 1:30 pm Naeva, yay! So glad you liked it. And yeah, I\u2019m with you on that self control thing\u2026 Reply Aubrey Schmidt says May 26, 2013 at 1:38 pm If you use a mug I would maybe not have the brownie in the microwave for 70 seconds, it kinda burns the bottom and makes it hard! But other than that it was great! Reply Abby says May 31, 2013 at 5:12 pm taste like hot crumble dirt. Reply kelly says October 13, 2014 at 8:54 pm Mine tasted ok but in no was was similar to a brownie. Was like chocolate crumbles. What did I do wrong?? Reply Christi says October 14, 2014 at 9:04 am Kelly, you might have cooked it a few seconds too long for your microwave. Microwaves have so much variation, and this is absolutely a recipe that starts to get dry and crumbly if overcooked. I would try it again and cut a few seconds off the time at least. Under cooked is better than over cooked with these! Reply Brianna says June 2, 2013 at 6:11 pm I only put 1 tbsp of sugar because i have been very into sweets lately\u2026. and it was still incredible! The best microwavable brownie i have tried yet!! So happy i have found \u2018THE ONE\u2019 !! Reply Brianna says June 2, 2013 at 6:13 pm Wanted to add that as pp said, i used a mug and only did about 40 seconds and it was perfect. Any longer would have been too much. I just had a gut feeling.. Reply Bellaboo says July 22, 2013 at 2:21 pm I just fell in love with you and the brownies\u2026 im not sure who i love more \ud83d\ude42 YOU MADE MY DAY :\u2019) yes, that was just a small tear \ud83d\ude42 Reply isla says July 23, 2013 at 3:18 pm I\u2019ve now tried to make these twice, the first time I found using oil gave it a weird taste and texture, so the second time i used 3 tbsp butter, they were PERFECT. Reply kate says July 31, 2013 at 6:43 pm I love this but how many calories? Reply Christi @ Love From The Oven says August 1, 2013 at 6:58 am Kate, I don\u2019t figure the calories for the recipes, but I\u2019m sure you can figure it out through one of the recipe calorie converter site\u2026 http://caloriecount.about.com/cc/recipe_analysis.php Reply Nazo says October 19, 2013 at 9:05 am I love this recipe! The other recipes I\u2019ve tried for microwave brownies came out as dry and tasteless, but I love topping this one with some chocolate chips and powdered sugar. \ud83d\ude42 Reply Tash says January 19, 2014 at 2:02 pm WOW !! Just made it and it tasted delicious!! Wasn\u2019t sure if it was going to work at first but it does Reply Junie says February 18, 2014 at 3:57 pm I added a few peppermint chips instead of chocolate, and it was DIVINE. I love this! Reply Me says March 5, 2014 at 1:08 am I just tried to make this using two TBS of oil as recommended for a ore moist brownie, and it didn\u2019t work at all! Really really sad \ud83d\ude41 Reply Angie says July 2, 2014 at 6:21 pm Looks dangerous! But in a totally delicious way. \ud83d\ude00 What size ramekin did you use? I\u2019ve been wanting to try several single-serve microwave desserts, but I\u2019m never sure if my standard coffee mugs are big enough. As far as ramekins, I only have 4 oz size, and then I have some 5 oz glass jars Would these be big enough for this recipe? Reply Christi says July 3, 2014 at 7:00 am Angie, I think those would be fine. My ramekins are probably about the width of a coffee cup. \ud83d\ude42 Reply Emily Easterling says September 7, 2014 at 7:11 pm just pulled this out of the microwave- we loved it! really good brownie flavor. we added white chocolate chips.. yum!! Reply Leslie says February 20, 2015 at 9:19 am Made this last night and it was DELICIOUS! Easy to be addicting. Has anyone tried substituting some of the sugar? That\u2019s my only concern is that 3TBSP of sugar is a lot\u2026let me know if you have suggestions! Reply Christi says February 20, 2015 at 11:13 am Leslie, I think you could absolutely try cutting back the sugar, that\u2019s really going to come down to personal taste. Let me know if you try and how it goes, but I would think 2 TBSP could absolutely work (and possibly less) or using something like Truvia. Reply Alyssa says March 1, 2015 at 10:59 am I just tried these to surprise my brother who just got out of the hospital, and we both loved them! They were the perfect size, and wonderfully nostalgic to share together. A+++ Reply Christi says March 2, 2015 at 6:18 am So glad you liked them Alyssa, I hope your brother is doing better! Reply Kim says July 22, 2015 at 6:06 pm Well, that hit the spot! Turned out perfectly for me. I think I might do as someone suggested above and dissolve the sugar in the wet ingredients as it was a big grainy but other than that, it was great. I cooked mine in a standard size coffee mug, for 45 seconds, then an additional 15. Then I topped it with caramel ice cream topping. Delicious! I can\u2019t say it\u2019s EXACTLY like a brownie, but I am tempted to run upstairs and make another one\u2026! Thanks for the recipe. Reply Amanda says August 15, 2015 at 5:53 pm I love this recipe! So easy to make. This it\u2019s great so I don\u2019t eat the whole pan! Reply Ikhlas says February 2, 2016 at 10:18 pm Just made these! Unfortunately, they turned out quite dry for me \ud83d\ude41 I only put 1 tbsp of oil and microwaved them for 70 seconds. 25 seconds before it finished, I heard a sizzling sound and I immediately took it out to discover that it had overcooked. It was more like a dry mug cake than brownie for me, but I think it was because of the high heat of my microwave. Will definitely try this again with less time! Reply Malaz Nour says July 9, 2016 at 9:51 pm So I\u2019m about to figure out if it\u2019s okay to use powdered vanilla instead of liquid wish me luck! Reply LucyNY says September 3, 2016 at 3:28 pm Was stuck in the house today, and decided to try this recipe. It was delicious! I will definitely make it again when I need a quick chocolate fix. Reply Ellie says January 6, 2017 at 12:07 am Just wanted to let you know that I am a huge fan of this recipe! It\u2019s perfect for satisfying my chocolate craving with nothing less than absolute decadence! \ud83d\ude0d I usually top it with my beloved almond milk ice cream, but today I opted for drizzling the whole shebang with full fat coconut milk and I loved that, too. Thanks for sharing this too-easy-for-my-own-good recipe! P.S. Because I am a total weirdo, I tried halving this recipe when I felt like a less guilty dessert. It totally worked! Reply Christi says January 7, 2017 at 2:09 pm Ellie, I\u2019m so happy to hear you like the recipe! Sometimes you just have to take care of that chocolate craving! Enjoy and Happy New Year! Reply Clarinet :P says January 8, 2017 at 2:30 pm The first time it came out VERY runny, so I cut back on the oil. Wasn\u2019t sweet enough for me so I topped it with powdered sugar! OH YEA! Im eating this all MYSELF!!! \ud83d\ude00 Reply Christi says January 9, 2017 at 1:18 pm Enjoy! Reply Sonali says May 21, 2017 at 5:40 pm Wooooould anyone judge me if I said I ate this raw? It was delicious, 10/10 would make again Reply Sonali says May 21, 2017 at 5:41 pm P.S. I cut out the oil and swapped the butter for almond milk b/c I knew I wouldn\u2019t be baking it.

Peanut Butter Balls are my holiday go to, but my recipe  makes a zillion and calls for an entire pound of butter (no wonder I start every new year with muffin top). After a little experimenting I\u2019ve found the perfect peanut butter/butter/powdered sugar ratio to make only THREE peanut butter balls! It takes 5 minutes, and they\u2019re perfect for when you\u2019re craving a super rich dessert, but don\u2019t want a bunch of leftovers hanging around to tempt you later. A plastic fork with the center two prongs snapped off is the perfect chocolate dipping tool. It allows the excess chocolate drip right off. The chocolate isn\u2019t nearly as shiny and smooth as it is when I melt it in my double boiler  with a little paraffin wax, but it really doesn\u2019t matter what they look like\u2026 because I\u2019m going to promptly eat every last one of them. Just for the record, dear Ohioans, these are not buckeyes. To be a buckeye a peanut butter ball must have part of the peanut butter center left un-chocolate coated, and I think that is a wasted opportunity! ;) Here\u2019s the recipe! 4 teaspoons peanut butter 1 tablespoon softened butter 1/4 cup (slightly heaping) powdered sugar 1/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips Stir together the peanut butter and butter until they are well combined and smooth. Stir in the powdered sugar. Roll the dough into three balls.\u00a0Melt the chocolate chips in the microwave, and\u00a0coat the peanut butter balls in chocolate. Let the chocolate set and harden a bit\u00a0(stick them in the fridge if you\u2019re impatient), and enjoy! 35 Comments September 4, 2012 Post navigation \u2190  Hand Lettering Practice #3 Spider Appreciation Day \u2192 35 comments Lindsey September 4, 2012 at 6:54 pm Oh yum!  My grandma (an Ohioan) makes buckeyes every Christmas.  For a little added goodness she adds very finely crush graham crackers to the peanut butter. Reply Pam S. September 4, 2012 at 8:48 pm Lindsey, my mother-in-law makes peanut butter balls (sans the buckeye; she\u2019s from Illinois).  I believe she uses crushed grahams too. They\u2019re always my most favorite :) Pam S. September 4, 2012 at 7:08 pm *GASP* (these look positively scrummy!) Reply Amy September 4, 2012 at 8:31 pm ohhh my goodness!  I love peanut butter balls, but hate making a full load of them, primarily because my boyfriend and I are sweetaholics and they will be devoured in a day. I am so happy you have provided the recipe for a few at a time. Reply Kaytie September 4, 2012 at 9:45 pm Haha \u2013 before I finished reading your post I was going to comment, \u201cthose aren\u2019t peanut butter balls, those are buckeyes!\u201d but I am from Ohio after all. In btw. love your idea with the two prong fork dipping, it looks so much simpler than my usual toothpick version. :) Reply Amanda (wit & whistle) Post author September 4, 2012 at 11:11 pm Haha! Oh, you Ohioans. ;) Kate @ imperfectdelights September 5, 2012 at 1:17 am How simple, practical and delectable \u2013 I just havvvvve to try these. Only problem, my boyfriend is sure to steal them all (he is a massive PB fan)! Kate Reply dana September 5, 2012 at 2:36 am I am thanking both you and the gods of portion control! This is so perfect!

I\u2019ll see if there\u2019s a wordpress plugin for that. ;) Katy September 5, 2012 at 7:46 pm I made these with almond butter (all I had on hand), so delicious!!! A great sweet treat after a long day Reply kristin September 5, 2012 at 9:07 pm Those look so yummy!\u2026and Gluten Free! I\u2019ll be making some very soon. :) Thanks for sharing Reply Karen T September 6, 2012 at 12:40 am I don\u2019t know whether to thank you or curse you. I share your feeling about peanut butter balls and Christmas and the saving grace has been that I only eat them once (at most) a year. Until now \u2026 Reply Michelle {LiveLoudly} September 6, 2012 at 6:11 pm This is the first thing my mom and I make for Christmas goodies. We\u2019ve added a couple thing variations over the years. We now crumble up Golden Grahams (cereal) into the mixture. So good!! we also do white chocolate ones now. K, now I\u2019m craving them already. -Michelle {LiveLoudly} Reply Chrystina September 6, 2012 at 8:31 pm I\u2019m so excited that you took the time to perfect this.  I\u2019m not even THAT huge of a fan of peanut butter (I know, I know \u2013 something\u2019s wrong with me), but I kind of want to try this now just because it looks so practical for \u201cthose\u201d dessert nights.  Thanks for sharing! Reply Kylie September 7, 2012 at 12:43 am Oh my! These taste exactly like the Peanut Butter Daisies from Purdy\u2019s! :) Reply Mn\u00eamosun\u00ea September 7, 2012 at 2:24 pm I\u2019ve never eat something like that, but I\u2019ll try, it seems yummy ! Reply Debbie Fish September 15, 2012 at 4:58 pm Yummy!  I just made these but being lazy and a chocolate lover that hates to waste, I tried something a tad different\u2026 I roughly chopped the chocolate chips and mixed them in with the sugar\u2026very yummy, I can imagine with them chocolate coated they are probably better but these are delicious!! Reply Mandinga September 25, 2012 at 9:31 pm Buckeyes are the best! And\u2026 yes, I\u201dll make them with a little bit of peanut butter sticking out. Hey\u2026. how did you know that I lived my first 22 years in Ohio?!?  :) Thanks for the individual recipe! Reply Ann October 22, 2012 at 2:59 pm I love this!  Must go out and buy chocolate chips and pb soon as this would be a perfect cure for when i have a chocolate craving! Reply Elana February 12, 2013 at 11:42 am Mine did not turn into a consistency that could be rolled\u2026idont know what I did wrong. Reply Amanda (wit & whistle) Post author February 12, 2013 at 12:06 pm If your butter was melted instead of softened that could be the problem, or if you are using natural peanut butter that is runny that would make them too soft to roll. You could try refrigerating the dough for a bit to solidify it before rolling. Amy C May 5, 2013 at 3:35 am Amanda \u2013 these look immense! Thanks for the recipe! xx Reply Monica May 14, 2013 at 11:45 pm This looks soooo delicious! Peanut butter is my favorite, and your plastic fork trick is so genius! I\u2019m going to have to try this (: Reply Emily October 6, 2013 at 4:31 pm Guys, fair warning: Don\u2019t make this! You will become addicted! Lol, they were delicious, and now I feel sick from eating about ten xD Reply Kat January 12, 2015 at 10:20 pm My husband and I are both OSU grads so I had to have something to make tonight\u2019s big playoff game against Oregon special. This was PERFECT!  I whipped it up in no time and no leftovers to tempt me tomorrow. Thanks! Reply Annalise February 17, 2015 at 9:20 am Hi! Thank you so much for making this! I skipped forming the individual balls altogether and just mixed the peanut butter mixture with the melted chocolate, and popped it in the freezer. It tasted amazing. With a little cream they could have been the perfect ice cream. ;) Reply Keven April 25, 2015 at 3:20 am I\u2019m a huge fan of single-serve recipes because they are just plain practical. I want to be able to make whatever I\u2019m craving without wasting ingredients or having to deal with leftovers. This particular recipe caught my interest because I had a huge craving for a quick dessert, and I love chocolate and peanut butter. And, I\u2019ve got to hand it to you \u2013 this recipe is awesome! It met my every expectation for a practical single-serve recipe; it was quick, left no mess, appropriately portioned, and delicious. I was able to make it just now with a single bowl and a paper plate. The only real bad thing is that you have to wait for the chocolate to resolidify! I also want to note that I made a minor change to the recipe -substituting the 1/4 cup of semisweet chips with 1/8 cup milk chocolate chips and 1/8 cup of peanut butter/ semi sweet chips- because I don\u2019t really like the contrast between bitter chocolate and sweet things. With this change, for me, it was sinfully delectable. Rivaling Reese\u2019s, this recipe will help me satisfy any craving that I have for chocolate and peanut butter in the future. Reply Amanda (wit & whistle) Post author April 25, 2015 at 11:46 am I\u2019m so glad you liked them Keven! :) Hope August 6, 2015 at 11:31 pm I just made these with a slight twist~ Yesterday I made a small cake for myself; I needed to give myself a moment of calm to recharge in the face of the second half of the week and baking proved to be just the trick. I made a 6\u2033 cake but neglected to halve the frosting I made- a 1:1 chocolate to cream ratio ganache, chilled and whipped. I\u2019m not complaining about having extra rich, delicious chocolate sitting in the fridge, but I was snarfing down spoonfuls every time I walked past the fridge (I believe I\u2019ve taken the trash out 6 times in the past 24 hours). Now I have no problem eating the whole bowl, but for propriety\u2019s sake I thought I should  turn it into something a little more reminiscent of an actual dessert. One with, you know, portions. Since I wanted to control myself, I was looking around for single serving dessert recipes and stumbled upon this article and your site. I switched the recipe up a tiny bit by heating the butter and peanut butter before adding the powdered sugar. I also added a pinch of sea salt ( I found my peanut butter a tad sweet) and a dash of vanilla bean paste. I chilled this in the fridge while I scooped three 3/4\u2033 scoops of ganache and quickly rolled it in my hands into balls. I popped those in the freezer to firm up a tad. Once they were cool I wrapped them in the peanut batter and rolled them to smooth them. I rolled these in a dusting of cocoa powder and/or powdered sugar. After a minute in the fridge they are a wonderful chocolate-peanut butter treat! I can see why you needed to find a way to make the right amount- I would eat as much of this stuff as I could find! I am so happy I stumbled onto your site- everything here looks absolutely wonderful! Thank you for all of your hard work; I can\u2019t wait to sit down and pore over everything! Reply Amanda (wit & whistle) Post author August 10, 2015 at 9:27 pm Your twist sounds delicious!

That\u2019s right\u2014today, January 22nd, is apparently National Blondie Day. Since I consider myself a bit of a blondie queen , I couldn\u2019t possibly let it pass by unnoticed, now could I? I found out about this \u201choliday\u201d on Thursday night, as I was riding the emotional high that your kind comments  lent me. One particular comment  stuck out to me. Brenda said: Now, go dream up some wonderful super easy recipe for me to try out. So I did.  And wouldn\u2019t you know, it was a smashing success on the very first try! This recipe: uses common ingredients works with a variety of substitutions takes less than 5 minutes to prepare from start to finish requires only one piece of equipment (food processor) conveniently makes just one serving doesn\u2019t require any advance prep does NOT require baking OR dehydration provides instant gratification It also happens to be: raw vegan gluten-free grain-free dairy-free oil-free and frickin\u2019 DELICIOUS! So here it is, folks. This is the treat I spontaneously concocted in my kitchen on Thursday night, thanks in large part to YOU. Consider it my little way of saying \u201cthank you,\u201d again . Print The 5-Minute, Single-Serving, Raw Vegan Blondie Yield: 1 generous serving Ingredients 1/4 cup dry macadamia nuts or cashews 1/4 cup dry walnuts or pecans 2 tablespoons coconut palm sugar 2 to 3 pitted dates 1/8 teaspoon vanilla extract Big pinch of sea salt Cacao nibs, for garnish (optional) Instructions Combine the nuts and sugar in a mini food processor.  (A mini one works best, but I think a regular-sized one would be fine. Or you could just quadruple the recipe and make a family-size blondie!) Pulse the nuts and sugar together until the mixture is ground into a coarse powder. Add the dates, one at a time, pulsing several times between additions, until each date is well-incorporated. (If you have fairly large dates, like Medjools, use 2. If you have small dates, or an insane sweet tooth, use 3.) After the last date is incorporated, add the vanilla and a generous pinch of salt. (I've always loved the salted-caramel undertones that good blondies have.) Pulse several more times to distribute the vanilla and salt. Transfer the mixture into a single (unlined) muffin cup and use your fingers to pack it down tightly. (Or, you could just as easily form it into a cake shape on a small plate! Just be sure to press it together very  well so it doesn't fall apart.) Run a knife around the edge of the muffin cup and invert the blondie onto a small plate. Garnish with cacao nibs, if desired. (My chocolate-hazelnut ganache  would also make a perfect topping for this!) Notes Substitution Options - Nuts: any combination of nuts and seeds totaling \u00bd\u00a0cup. Choose from macnuts, cashews, pecans, or walnuts, as called for, or try Brazil nuts, hazelnuts, almonds, or even sunflower seeds. - Coconut palm sugar:  Sucanat, date sugar, maple sugar, unpacked brown sugar, evaporated cane juice, organic white sugar, or any other granulated sweetener in place of the coconut palm sugar. Or leave it out entirely for a sugar-free blondie! - Dates: 2 Tbsp of any sweet, soft  dried fruit instead of dates. \u00a0It would change the flavor a bit, but you could try raisins, golden raisins, prunes, dried figs,\u00a0or dried cherries, for example. 3.1 http://chefambershea.com/2011/01/22/the-5-minute-single-serving-raw-vegan-blondie/ \u00a9 2013 ChefAmberShea.com And that\u2019s it.  It\u2019s that simple, I swear! Eat it with a fork or simply out-of-hand, your choice. I\u2019m not trying to brag, but seriously\u2026this thing is outrageous. The oils released by the ground nuts combine with the succulent dates to make it astonishingly moist\u2026yet it\u2019s also nutty and slightly crumbly. The vanilla, sugar, and salt marry seamlessly into a butterscotch-like flavor. CRAZY, CRAZY GOOD. Not to mention: this blondie is fast, easy, and inexpensive to make; raw, vegan, and gluten-free; and unbelievably, mouthwateringly scrumptious. You have no reason NOT to make this! If you try it, please let me know how much you love it. Happy National Blondie Day, indeed! Check it out! Tara at Vegan Piggy  has already made my recipe \u2013 don\u2019t miss her post !

I\u2019m going to have to make one of these\u2026 mmm. January 22, 2011  at 1:59 pm Amber Shea @Almost Vegan Haha, very astute observation, Megan \ud83d\ude09  You hit the nail on the head.

January 22, 2011  at 3:30 pm vivaciousvegan I think this looks tasty, is there anyway you can make it with out processed sugar? January 22, 2011  at 2:34 pm Amber Shea @Almost Vegan Sure!  If you eat stevia, you could use a few drops of that in place of the sugar (though you might want to add a couple tablespoons more nuts to make up for the loss in volume, OR just use 1-2 dates instead of 2-3).  If you try that, let me know how it works!  \ud83d\ude42 January 22, 2011  at 2:38 pm Mary Crouch Young So I don\u2019t really like dates.  What might I use instead? January 22, 2011  at 2:59 pm Amber Shea @Almost Vegan Check out the instructions \u2013 I suggest a few substitutions.  \ud83d\ude00  If you try any of them, let me know how it turns out!

I\u2019m putting the \u201calmost\u201d in my \u201calmost raw\u201d by having a bison burger tonight (I know, bad, evil naughty Hillary!\u2026.but it was on sale!). Raw side dishes and toppings, though\u2026..and now the perfect raw dessert that I just happen to have everything for ;).  I\u2019m considering a raw blackberry coulis as an accompaniment. January 22, 2011  at 4:58 pm Amber Shea @Almost Vegan Tsk tsk, young lady!  Ah well, your sides and toppings do earn you some karma back \ud83d\ude09 Yesss, blackberries, my favorite!  I think that would go great with this. January 22, 2011  at 5:00 pm Kylie @ A Hungry Spoon Yay!  So glad you posted the recipe\u2013can\u2019t wait to try it \ud83d\ude42  And the chocolate crinkle cookies were VERY easy!  They came together super quick, and Adam just said this afternoon they\u2019re his most recent favorite cookie \ud83d\ude42  I changed the recipe a bit from the one in the book (reduced the sugar, added yogurt, eliminated corn syrup, etc.), but they were awesome just the same.  Happy Blondie Day! January 22, 2011  at 4:59 pm Amber Shea @Almost Vegan Good to know about the cookies.  If I make them, I\u2019ll probably reduce the sugar too. I hope you do try the blondie!  Let me know!  \ud83d\ude00 January 22, 2011  at 5:01 pm Ela Did your survey yesterday. Sounds like a  yummy and simple recipe: I love raw foods! I actually made Evan (Wannabe Chef)\u2019s blondies for Phil and our guests last night\u2013butter, flour, sugar, so not for me, obviously, but sweet that we\u2019re on the same wavelength there! I\u2019m avoiding dates right now but might try it with chia-sweet. Or make it for Phil\u2026 Happy blondie day! love Ela January 22, 2011  at 5:37 pm Amber Shea @Almost Vegan Thanks for participating in my survey. Hehe, we ARE rather in sync!  Hope your guests enjoyed your blondies as much as I enjoyed mine \ud83d\ude09 If you do try it with chia-sweet, let me know how it turns out! January 22, 2011  at 6:27 pm Moni'sMeals looks really good! Happy Blondie day! January 22, 2011  at 5:42 pm Amber Shea @Almost Vegan Hehe, thanks!  Happy blondie day to you too, blondie!  \ud83d\ude1b January 22, 2011  at 6:27 pm Aparna Wow, Amber, so I just made this and put some Love Street Coconut Spread on top of it\u2013my parents and I LOVED it! Thanks for making my day \ud83d\ude42 January 22, 2011  at 6:25 pm Amber Shea @Almost Vegan You did?!  That is AWESOME, I\u2019m so glad to hear that!  I bet it\u2019s amazing with the coconut spread.  Thanks for making MY day! January 22, 2011  at 6:29 pm Aparna I did make it \ud83d\ude42 Exactly the way your recipe was and it was so cute and adorable (nice timing\u2013I had all the ingredients available!) and next time I want to add some macadamia nuts or pecans and make larger portions to share more! I also shared your recipe with a few friends who are also going to try it out. Super easy, delicious, and way healthier than a conventional blondie (no heavy feeling afterwards). January 22, 2011  at 7:34 pm Amber Shea @Almost Vegan My thoughts exactly! I\u2019m so happy to hear you enjoyed it so much. I hope your friends do too! January 22, 2011  at 7:37 pm Pure2raw twins YUM! Blondie looks perfect \ud83d\ude42 January 22, 2011  at 8:13 pm Amber Shea @Almost Vegan Thank ya! January 22, 2011  at 10:29 pm Hannah I really, really, really, really am going to make this as *soon* as I\u2019ve finished the last bit of my raw key lime pie! Amber, you are just the awesome. And I can\u2019t help thinking of all the ways to play with this in future! Almond extract, or some coffee grounds (though I suppose that isn\u2019t raw), or some figs instead of dates\u2026. be still my beating heart! I\u2019m also so thankful for the single-serving recipe. It\u2019s not that I mind eating 12 lots of something in three days, but I just never enjoy it as much by the end as I did at first. Hurrah hurrah for something that won\u2019t give me taste-fatigue! Gorgeous photos, too \ud83d\ude42 January 22, 2011  at 8:13 pm Amber Shea @Almost Vegan Coffee grounds is a great idea, and dried figs in place of dates?  Pure BRILLIANCE!  I\u2019m editing this post to include that, in fact \u2013 why didn\u2019t I think of that?!  \ud83d\ude1b I hear ya on the seemingly endless parade of leftovers.  Sometimes it\u2019s nice to have something that you prep, love, and then make disappear all at once.  \ud83d\ude42  Glad you like the photos too! January 22, 2011  at 10:32 pm Diana Beautiful photos! Lol I\u2019m lying in bed about to sleep and I\u2019m getting hungry just looking at them. Btw love love love the sprinkle of cacao nibs! January 22, 2011  at 11:58 pm Amber Shea @Almost Vegan Hehe, I hope you had sweet blondie dreams!  \ud83d\ude1b January 23, 2011  at 12:41 pm katshealthcorner So beautiful!!! I love how you used a cupcake pan to mold you brownie! I never would have thought of that!!  So amazing! \ud83d\ude00 January 23, 2011  at 11:20 am Amber Shea @Almost Vegan Aw, thanks Kat!  \ud83d\ude00  Hope you try the recipe!

January 23, 2011  at 8:03 pm Amber Shea @Almost Vegan Hehe!  You hiring?  \ud83d\ude1b  I\u2019d love to! January 24, 2011  at 9:47 am rachelsmusicalkitchen Sounds amazing! January 23, 2011  at 8:30 pm Amber Shea @Almost Vegan I have to say, it is! January 24, 2011  at 9:48 am bitt YUM! will make for sure. January 23, 2011  at 9:01 pm Amber Shea @Almost Vegan Cool!  Be sure to let me know how you like it. January 24, 2011  at 9:48 am Lauren Slayton this recipe is a keeper, wish I dreamed up such good recipes. Sad to admit but I\u2019m not a food processing gal, can I blend this? January 24, 2011  at 7:05 am Amber Shea @Almost Vegan Thanks Lauren!  Unfortunately I don\u2019t think a blender would work for this; the dough is too coarse and dense, and the dates wouldn\u2019t get incorporated well enough.  However, you give me an idea\u2026I\u2019m thinking you could grind all the nuts by some other means (dry blender, nut grinder, mortar and pestle, or even thoroughly by hand) and put them in a bowl with the palm sugar.  Then, you could try using 2 Tbsp of a very heavy/thick/viscous liquid sweetener, like raw honey or brown rice syrup, INSTEAD OF the dates.  Add the salt and vanilla and use your hands or a wooden spoon to mash it together, and ta-da!  I think that might just work! January 24, 2011  at 9:56 am Mat I have a little get together this week, i think this after dinner is gonna be the play.  Thanks January 24, 2011  at 8:28 am Amber Shea @Almost Vegan That\u2019s great!  Let me know how it goes! January 24, 2011  at 9:49 am Michelle I can\u2019t wait to try this recipe out!  This blondie sounds amazing!  I\u2019m thinking here\u2026..I may need to double the recipe and make some mini ones in a mini muffin pan.  I just need to by walnuts.  :o) January 24, 2011  at 10:18 am Amber Shea @Almost Vegan Thanks Michelle!  Mini ones would be awesome.  And if you don\u2019t have walnuts, you can use pecans! January 24, 2011  at 10:19 am TheHealthyapron I freakin\u2019 can\u2019t wait to try this recipe!! You are so creative! I cannot come up with recipes on my own! Kudos! January 24, 2011  at 10:29 am Amber Shea @Almost Vegan Aww, thank you Erin!  When you make it, please let me know how you like it!  \ud83d\ude00 January 24, 2011  at 10:34 am River (Wing-It Vegan) What a beautiful blondie! And the food ain\u2019t bad either! \ud83d\ude1b Don\u2019t listen to the haters! You are awesome, and beautiful, and talented, so I\u2019m sure you\u2019re going to encounter more haters in the future. But 99.999999999% of your readers think you\u2019re *da bomb*! Don\u2019t let the tiny haters get you down! \ud83d\ude42 January 24, 2011  at 11:33 am Amber Shea @Almost Vegan Thanks so much, River \ud83d\ude42  You are too sweet! January 24, 2011  at 11:56 am hihorosie Oooh! Yummy! I love how simple it is but truly looks so delectable! I\u2019ll have to see if I\u2019ve got these ingredients on hand (I have most but might not have enough nuts \u2013 excuse to get more) because I love dessert, including little blondies! \ud83d\ude09 January 24, 2011  at 4:06 pm Amber Shea @Almost Vegan You\u2019ll have to let me know if you try it!  Keep in mind there are possible substitutions for both nuts.  Mix \u2018n match to your heart\u2019s content!  \ud83d\ude42 January 24, 2011  at 4:10 pm hihorosie Oooh yeah, like cashews and macs for extra richness! \ud83d\ude09 January 24, 2011  at 4:35 pm Amber Shea @Almost Vegan Absolutely!  Yummm\u2026 January 24, 2011  at 4:36 pm Tamarind Ball I read your blog this morning and during the lunch hour popped out to my natural grain store to get the required ingredients for a blondie making extravaganza when I get in later. But at around three o\u2019clock this afternoon, I experienced a bit of an energy drain and needed to put some pep in my step\u2026 what did I do? I took five cashew nuts, two pecans and half of a date, and pop them into my mouth and chewed \u2013 and had the most amazing flavor! Lol! I guess you can say I made my own blondie \u2026. that gave me just enough pep to take me through the afternoon \u2013 dried fruit and nuts wins everytime! \ud83d\ude42 January 25, 2011  at 1:49 pm Amber Shea @Almost Vegan That is a brilliant  idea.  A deconstructed blondie bite\u2026I love it!  And energizing, to boot. Let me know how your blondies turn out tonight with pecans! January 25, 2011  at 2:12 pm Melissa Single serving sweet treats are G E N I U S !!!! Thank you I can\u2019t wait to get the proper nuts into the house\u2026all I have is Hazelnut (could be good) and Pignoli ( thinking not so much).  I have been following you for a while now and wanted to drop a note.  Please do not let those whose hateful comments would detract you from your journey.   You are an inspiration! January 26, 2011  at 12:54 pm Amber Shea @Almost Vegan Thanks for saying hello, Melissa!  \ud83d\ude00  I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re liking the single-serving treat ideas.  You\u2019re right, hazelnuts could be good in this, but I think pine nuts are a little too much on the savory side.  Thank you so much for the sweet compliments! January 26, 2011  at 1:05 pm Erik Marcus Blogged at Vegan.com: http://vegan.com/blog/2011/01/31/raw-vegan-blondies/ Beautiful stuff, Amber. I know my readers will be thrilled to check this one out! January 31, 2011  at 2:12 pm Amber Shea @Almost Vegan Thank you so much, Erik!  I\u2019m certain they\u2019ll love it as much as I do. I look forward to working with you again!  \ud83d\ude42 January 31, 2011  at 3:10 pm Justin I am one of Erik\u2019s readers and I CANNOT WAIT to make this!!! Thank you both for what you do!! January 31, 2011  at 2:45 pm Amber Shea @Almost Vegan Thank YOU for reading, Justin!  Please let me know how you like the blondie \ud83d\ude00 January 31, 2011  at 3:11 pm Debbie@Live from La Quinta Haooy to see today that your recipe was shared on vegan.com (with an appropriate link to your blog). January 31, 2011  at 2:47 pm Amber Shea @Almost Vegan I just saw that as well!  I\u2019m thrilled \ud83d\ude42 January 31, 2011  at 3:12 pm Danu Just made and enjoyed this.  Certainly very very simple and fun to make.  Looks lovely, appealing and stylish on a little plate. I could easily have foregone the sugar I think, as the dates were sweet enough. Indeed, next time I might add more dates for texture and leave out the sugar. I added some dessicated coconut which gave a lovely flavour and made the finished blondie even blonder. There is something very beautiful about this little blondie; I\u2019ll definitely make it for friends. I used a ramekin in place of muffin tins, it was just as simple to turn out. Yummy, thanks so much for this simple and delicious recipe \ud83d\ude42 x February 1, 2011  at 5:20 pm Amber Shea @Almost Vegan Thank you for the lovely comment, Danu!  This blondie IS quite sweet (I tend to like desserts that way), but I\u2019m certain it would be just fine without the sugar; you might just add another date instead.  I love that you included coconut; that\u2019s a great flavor combo. I\u2019m so pleased that you enjoyed it, and will share it with friends.  \ud83d\ude42 February 1, 2011  at 5:44 pm Catherine These are soooooooooooo good!!! I processed it a little more and reached a cookie-dough texture.. yummy!!! I also incorporated the raw cacao nibs in the recipe instead of using them as topping. I formed tiny little balls and froze them for a while.. served on banana soft serve.. it was like eating cookie-dough ice-cream! Thanks Amber for this wonderfully decadent treat! February 7, 2011  at 4:11 pm Amber Shea @Almost Vegan Oh wow, I LOVE your raw chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream idea!  Sheer brilliance!  That is so going on my \u201cto-try\u201d list.  Thank YOU!  \ud83d\ude1b February 7, 2011  at 4:14 pm Mama Kelly aka Jia Followed a link on another blog and so glad I did.  I have bookmarked this and look forward to sitting down to a snack that tastes as good as it is good for me!!! February 9, 2011  at 7:39 pm Amber Shea @Almost Vegan I love hearing that!  Please let me know how you like it once you\u2019ve made it.  \ud83d\ude42 February 9, 2011  at 7:47 pm Deanna OMG. I finally made this. Well, my riff on it. I used 4 brazil nuts in place of cashews and 4 dates, but no palm sugar \u2013 and threw everything in my coffee grinder and said \u201cscrew packing it \u2013 I\u2019m eating it with a spoon\u201d and it is SOOOOO good. Thank you! February 12, 2011  at 12:15 pm Amber Shea @Almost Vegan Yet another awesome variation!  I\u2019m loving what everyone\u2019s coming up with.  So happy to hear you enjoyed it as much as I did.  \ud83d\ude42  Great idea, too, with the coffee grinder! February 12, 2011  at 1:15 pm ashli norton made this and it didnt stick together for me\u2026SOOOO\u2026I just put this in a bowl with some Almond Milk and it became my morning (and afternoon) cereal! April 17, 2011  at 11:36 am Amber Shea @Almost Vegan Aw, so sorry to hear it didn\u2019t stick together, Ashli!  If your dates were particularly dry, that could have affected it.  Next time, try adding another date or two \u2013 that\u2019s where the stickiness should comes from.  However, I LOVE the \u201cblondie cereal\u201d with almond milk idea!  I may have to try that sometime on purpose!  \ud83d\ude1b April 17, 2011  at 11:39 am Rose Tried it tonight for the second time and it was just as delicious as the first time, but better because this time around I followed directions \ud83d\ude42 The first time I was too excited and just threw everything into the food processor, the result was that it didn\u2019t stick together (maybe this is what happened to Ashli\u2019s?). Although, it did still taste delish!! \ud83d\ude42 Second time around, I followed directions and my blondie came out perfect!! So perfect that I forgot to take a picture of it before I ate it all. Oh well, guess I\u2019ll have to make it a third time! April 26, 2011  at 11:21 pm Amber Shea @Almost Vegan Rose, thank you so much for your comment!  You made my day \ud83d\ude00  I guess I didn\u2019t think before about how important the \u201corder of operations\u201d is \u2013 good tip!  I\u2019m so so happy to hear you tried it again and that the results were so perfect!  Here\u2019s to a future full of delicious raw blondies ::clink::   \ud83d\ude1b April 27, 2011  at 1:35 pm serenity3212 so yummy, i used macs instead of walnuts because i had none and it turned out fantastic! thanks for the recipe \ud83d\ude42 July 29, 2011  at 12:36 pm Amber Shea @Almost Vegan You\u2019re so welcome!  I\u2019m thrilled that you loved it!  \ud83d\ude00 July 29, 2011  at 1:55 pm Healthy Hot and Happy These looks and sounds incredible! I am so happy I found your blog today \u2013 so many great vegan recipes to try. \ud83d\ude42 September 9, 2011  at 10:23 am Amber Shea @Almost Vegan Thank you!  I\u2019m glad you found me, too \ud83d\ude00  A bigger-batch version of this blondie will be in my cookbook, out in 2012! September 9, 2011  at 10:25 am Vegan Bakerista Beautiful photos Amber!!  What a great recipe!  I love the cacao garnish! October 24, 2011  at 1:34 pm Amber Shea @Almost Vegan Thank you so much!  I hope you give this recipe a go  \ud83d\ude42 October 24, 2011  at 10:17 pm Jill These Blondies are AWESOME!!  I wanted to make enough for 4 people, and I made them into balls (not exactly small) and got about 20 of them!!  I rolled them in the cocoa nibs after making them into balls. Amazing!!!  Thank you so much for this recipe\u2026This will be repeated many times I am sure!!! December 30, 2011  at 6:49 pm Amber Shea @Almost Vegan YAY!  I\u2019m so happy to hear that, Jill!  Thanks for letting me know  \ud83d\ude00 December 30, 2011  at 6:55 pm brandi taylor These look heavenly \ud83d\ude42 January 19, 2012  at 7:13 pm Amber Shea @Almost Vegan Thanks, Brandi!  They ARE! January 19, 2012  at 7:16 pm ellen It was AH-MAZING! Thanks for sharing! February 8, 2012  at 4:23 pm Amber Shea @Almost Vegan Yay!  You\u2019re welcome, and thanks for letting me know you like it! February 8, 2012  at 4:28 pm grace @ goodness gracious Hi Amber. I saw this post when you originally put it up and thought, \u2018I must try that!\u2019\u2026sadly life got in the way and I forgot about the blondies, but the recipe sat posted to my fridge, watching me every day. It wasn\u2019t until Eva at Uncooking 101 wrote about it a couple of days ago that I was reminded to get on it! WELL, not only was this super simple, it was even easier for me because I had a jar of a mixture of ground up nuts in the fridge (ready for smoothies or as a topping) so I just use those with the dates, coconut sugar, vanilla and salt. Took about 2 minutes.  I made 2 mini blondies and ate one immediately. #2 is waiting for my man friend to get home\u2026but he better hurry up or it will be gone! I posted about it on my fb page \ud83d\ude42 https://www.facebook.com/GoodnessGraciousHealth?ref=tn_tnmn February 10, 2012  at 1:21 am Amber Shea @Almost Vegan SO happy to hear you finally made this \u2013 and that you love it! I often split it in half too, so I can double my snacktimes with it \ud83d\ude09 PS \u2013 You\u2019ll find a big-batch version of these blondies in Practically Raw ! \ud83d\ude00 February 10, 2012  at 9:47 am Miranda Just made 2 servings of this \u2013 it was amazing.  Even my non vegan, meat loving husband loved it and couldn\u2019t finish it because it was so rich!  I imagine it with a big scoop of coconut milk ice cream\u2026YUM.  Thank you for this awesome, awesome recipe! February 26, 2012  at 8:32 pm Amber Shea @Almost Vegan Thank you so much, Miranda!  That is wonderful to hear.  So happy you both enjoyed it! February 26, 2012  at 9:00 pm Robert Tregillis Thank you for the recipe, it was delicious. I am just beginning my vegan journey and this certainly makes it easier. March 6, 2012  at 9:26 pm Amber Shea @Almost Vegan You are very welcome, Robert!  I\u2019m so glad to hear that. March 7, 2012  at 9:53 am Miranda @ The Pinterest Project Just featured these on our blog: http://pinterest-project.blogspot.com/2012/03/blondes-have-more-fun.html March 20, 2012  at 9:39 am Amber Shea @Almost Vegan Awesome!  I\u2019m so glad you found it/me on Pinterest and gave it a shot \u2013 and fell in love! A bigger-batch version of this blondie is in my new cookbook Practically Raw  \u2013 and it may just be my favorite recipe in the whole book.  \ud83d\ude09 March 20, 2012  at 9:45 am Hannah I made these for the first time today and they turned out super oily (delicious, but oily).  I\u2019m new to raw food.  Any idea what I did wrong? March 22, 2012  at 6:00 pm Amber Shea @Almost Vegan Sounds like you may have overprocessed the nuts.  If you blend them too long, they can release their oils and start to get kind of buttery.  Next time, try just pulsing them into coarse crumbs, and then pulsing the dates in until JUST incorporated.  It\u2019s ok if some big chunks remain.  Hope that helps! March 22, 2012  at 6:02 pm Hannah Ah!  You are right.  I processed the heck out of those nuts!  Thanks\u2026I will try again! \ud83d\ude42 March 22, 2012  at 7:17 pm Kristin I just found this recipe this morning and I couldn\u2019t wait to try it out! I didn\u2019t even know I liked dates until just about a month ago. These were incredible! Thank you! P.S. I added your cookbook to my Amazon Wish List too. I can\u2019t wait to buy it! May 4, 2012  at 1:06 pm Amber Shea @Almost Vegan So glad you like them!  (The dates AND the blondie)  \ud83d\ude09 Enjoy the book!! May 4, 2012  at 1:28 pm Lauren This look great! Have you ever tried raisins in place of dates? May 10, 2012  at 12:14 pm Amber Shea @Almost Vegan Yup!  It works quite well.  I\u2019m partial to golden raisins.  \ud83d\ude42  1 Medjool date = about 1 Tbsp raisins. May 10, 2012  at 12:15 pm Tanya Zepeda Currently in HEAVEN with this one!!! You are dead on about the flavors combining to create a butterscotch flavor. Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU for this recipe!!!!! I\u2019ll be making this A LOT!!! (Quadrupling the recipe is GENIUS!) May 14, 2012  at 9:40 pm Amber Shea @Almost Vegan Hehe!  Aw, you\u2019re so welcome!  It\u2019s gotta be my favorite dessert of all time.  \ud83d\ude42  Be sure to check out the full-batch version in Practically Raw ! May 14, 2012  at 10:16 pm Averie @ Averie Cooks I just got done making blondies..but not the raw or vegan kind \ud83d\ude42  Yours look awesome! May 29, 2012  at 2:05 pm Amber Shea @Almost Vegan Blondies are the BEST! May 29, 2012  at 3:23 pm cheezyk I have no idea why this post suddenly appeared in my reader but I\u2019m sure glad it did, these look and sound fabulous \u2013 will definitely be giving them a try! May 29, 2012  at 5:38 pm Amber Shea @Almost Vegan I have no idea either!  It\u2019s almost a year and a half old\u2026but it\u2019s still one of my very favorites! May 29, 2012  at 5:40 pm Aubrey my day: mid-morn work break: found this recipe looking for easy vegan desserts lunch break: went to Kohl\u2019s and got a mini-processor (belated b-day gift to myself) after work: got the goods from the store and made this! As a newly vegan college girl on internship, I\u2019m using the summer away from the caf. to experiment with all the awesomeness this new diet has to offer\u2013and these are divine!! Thanks so much; I look forward to following your blog June 14, 2012  at 7:25 pm Amber Shea @Almost Vegan Aubrey, I love this!  Congrats on the new baby [food processor] \u2013 excellent self-gift, if I may say \u2013 and I\u2019m so happy you\u2019re loving this recipe.  (Btw, you\u2019ll find a full-batch version in my cookbook Practically Raw  \u2013 they last for weeks in the freezer!) Good luck in your newly-vegan adventures!  \ud83d\ude42 June 14, 2012  at 7:55 pm Susan Hi Amber, I found your blog this morning (I\u2019m wanting to add more vegan food into my diet) and realized when I saw this recipe that I had all of the ingredients. Just a few minutes later I was eating it. Absolutely delicious.  When I\u2019m in the mood for something sweet this will be an easy choice.  I loved it. June 17, 2012  at 3:01 pm Amber Shea @Almost Vegan Love that, Susan!  So happy you tried it and are enjoying it \u2013 and welcome!  \ud83d\ude42 June 17, 2012  at 3:03 pm Rachel Om nom nom!! A friend of a friend actually made a picnic-sized variation of these blondies for our 4th of July party and I was going nuts looking for the recipe since. I made this with my own variations based on what I had on hand, and now it\u2019s a favorite!! Also great for me to make in larger quantities so I can have something non-perishable to take me with to school. I was worried the mixture was too crumbly and not sticking together and that my dates weren\u2019t chopping\u2026but it turned out great. I usually double the recipe and put it into a fairly flat round container, so I can cut out pieces to eat and put the lid on to save the rest. But I wonder, would maple syrup work in place of the sugar or would it make the mixture too liquid? Here\u2019s what I used and it came out well: 1/2 cup raw cashews 1/2 cup dry roasted salted peanuts 2 tablespoons azulka morena organic cane sugar 4 regular/smallish dates 1/4 teaspoon vanilla (salt omitted due to using salted peanuts) August 16, 2012  at 5:10 pm Amber Shea @Almost Vegan Rachel, I am so happy to hear you enjoy this recipe so much!  I love the sound of your peanutty variation; I will have to try that sometime. I wouldn\u2019t try it with a liquid sweetener like maple syrup, BUT you could add a dash of maple extract  for flavor. By the way, you can find a full-batch version of these in my cookbook, Practically Raw ! August 16, 2012  at 5:17 pm Moi Contre Le Vie Can\u2019t WAIT to make these! You had me at \u201cfive minute!\u201d haha October 16, 2012  at 8:39 am Chef Amber Shea Hehe!  Enjoy! October 16, 2012  at 10:31 am Amie I just tried this recipe and I loved it!! It perfectly satisfied my sweet tooth \ud83d\ude42 I doubled it up but used xylitol instead of coconut palm sugar. I heard that once the liquid is extracted from the coconut tree for its sugar that the tree can no longer produce coconuts \ud83d\ude41 I can find other sugar subs but can\u2019t replace coconuts\u2026 I\u2019ll definitely make this recipe again and again, Thanks January 2, 2013  at 6:50 pm Chef Amber Shea Yay, so happy to hear that, Amie!  Great choice on the xylitol substitution. January 2, 2013  at 7:34 pm melissa Loved the single-serve option\u2013I have been wanting to make a smaller batch of the version in the cookbook, but wasn\u2019t sure if it would be too small for my regular-sized food processor. The nibs on top are a perfect complement. Thanks for this recipe! January 24, 2013  at 1:41 am Chef Amber Shea I never knew how invaluable a mini food processor is until I got one \ud83d\ude09  Thanks Melissa! January 24, 2013  at 2:09 am Carla I\u2019m eating this as I type \u2013 AMAZING!!!! Just so delish!! February 24, 2013  at 5:43 am Chef Amber Shea Awesome, thanks Carla!  \ud83d\ude42 February 24, 2013  at 4:43 pm CS OMG This sounds good! New sweet treat for me\u2026yay! March 13, 2013  at 7:08 pm Chef Amber Shea Thanks CS!  It\u2019s the BEST!  \ud83d\ude42 March 13, 2013  at 9:07 pm Mika Umm, I was wondering if I wanted to bake it, would I add flour? I realize this is supposed to be raw, but I just like the warm comforting taste of baked goods \ud83d\ude42 April 3, 2013  at 1:24 pm Chef Amber Shea Mika, this blondie shouldn\u2019t be baked \u2013 but if you\u2019re looking for a baked blondie, try this recipe instead! http://chefambershea.com/2010/09/16/white-chocolate-peanut-butter-blondies/   \ud83d\ude42 April 3, 2013  at 4:09 pm Mika Ahh, thank you so much \ud83d\ude42 I\u2019ll def. try it! April 3, 2013  at 5:30 pm deborah Just made it.  I used. Shredded coconut and chocolate chips.   Love it! May 19, 2013  at 5:01 am Chef Amber Shea Awesome!  Enjoy \ud83d\ude42 May 19, 2013  at 7:25 am Chantelle Nunez STOKED to come across your website and delicious recipes.  I\u2019m on the low FODMAP diet, which means I can\u2019t have dates (or other high fructose fruit), so do you think I could substitute coconut oil for the dates and a pinch of stevia? Thanks. October 29, 2013  at 8:22 am Chef Amber Shea Hi Chantelle, Dates would be difficult to replace with an oil like coconut, even if it were partially solid.  Are there any other dried fruits you can eat?  Raisins, figs, apricots, etc.?  If not, are there any sticky liquid sweeteners you can eat, like honey or coconut nectar? October 29, 2013  at 2:44 pm Renee I made these, they were too dry. I used Bob\u2019s Red Mill chopped dates and coconut. What can I do add honey or agave do it will stick together? Thx. December 19, 2013  at 10:22 pm Chef Amber Shea Next time, use whole (pitted) dates, not the pre-chopped kind.  Pre-chopped dates are coated with flour to keep them in pieces, and not only will the flour absorb too much moisture, but the dates themselves will be too dry to contribute the needed stickiness. To salvage the ones you made, though, feel free to add a drizzle of honey, maple syrup, agave, etc. and process them again till they stick together. December 19, 2013  at 10:25 pm Renee Thank you, how much agave would you suggest? December 19, 2013  at 10:34 pm Chef Amber Shea I would add just a teaspoon or so at a time, then see \u2013 you can always add more if you need it. \ud83d\ude42 December 19, 2013  at 10:38 pm Carol These Vegan blondes are AMAZING\u2026\u2026only one problem,once I start eating them I can\u2019t stop.

Thanks for the great recipe! October 9, 2014  at 1:54 am Annie This is a delicious slice \u2013 made this morning and half eaten already! Wondering if the addition of some coconut oil would help solidify the slice (as long as it is kept in the fridge).
