PA \u2013 While many professional athletes are taking a knee, many veterans are taking a stand. One group of veterans\u00a0released a statement last month about NFL players protesting during the National Anthem. They are condemning those actions. \u201cWe\u2019re the people that fought and defended the freedom to protest. There is a time and a place to protest,\u201d said Lackawanna County Council of Veterans Commander Joe Albert. The Council of Veterans say they are not condemning athletes using their platforms to protest, but as soldiers who have served active duty, they feel protesting the flag and the National Anthem is disrespecting the country they have fought for. Now, many veterans say they have turned the games off, and that they will take part in a national boycott of all NFL games on Sunday, Nov. 12, the day after Veterans Day. \u201c[NFL players] have so much power. It is wrong for them to abuse their power,\u201d said Ed Faatz, the president of Friends of the Forgotten. The Lackawanna County Veterans say protesting while in uniform is abusing that power, and that they should be doing it on their own time. \u201cIt\u2019s very disappointing because these are idols of society and it\u2019s trickling down. It\u2019s when the high school players start to do it. The college kids start to do it. Their coaches don\u2019t tolerate it,\u201d Albert said.

Kelly (who is currently the White House Chief of Staff) said in a Veterans Day speech: Those with less of a sense of service to the nation never understand it when men and women of character step forward to look danger and adversity straight in the eye, refusing to blink, or give ground, even to their own deaths. The protected can\u2019t begin to understand the price paid so they and their families can sleep safe and free at night. No, they are not victims, but are warriors, your warriors, and warriors are never victims, regardless of how and where they fall. Death, or fear of death, has no power over them. Their paths are paved by sacrifice, sacrifices they gladly make for you. Like those who went before them in uniform, we owe them everything. We owe them our safety. We owe them our prosperity. We owe them our freedom. We owe them our lives. Any one of them could have done something more self-serving with their lives as the vast majority of their age group elected to do after high school and college, but no, they chose to serve knowing full well a brutal war was in their future. They did not avoid the basic and cherished responsibility of a citizen\u2014the defense of country\u2014they welcomed it. They are the very best this country produces, and have put every one of us ahead of themselves. All are heroes for simply stepping forward, and we as a people owe a debt we can never fully pay.

Questions Background Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by Bonnie Burton, CNET.com) \u2013 On Nov. 3, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)  approved a new approach from the biotech company to MosquitoMate eradicate  certain mosquitoes. The goal is to destroy populations of wild mosquitoes that could be carrying (yellow fever, dengue and Zika) viruses, according to a report from Nature magazine. Instead of relying on   [The company will rear the infected mosquitoes in its Kentucky lab, sorting non-biting males from females. Then those males will be released at treatment sites to mate with wild females, producing eggs that don\u2019t hatch because\u00a0the paternal chromosomes don\u2019t form properly due to the effects of the bacterium.\u00a0The idea is that over time, as more male mosquitoes are released to mate with wild females, the population dwindles\u2014without having to resort to genetic engineering , MosquitoMate infects lab-grown mosquitoes with the common bacterium , which affects mosquitoes but not animals or humans. Wolbachia pipientis pesticides  that are not only harmful to people and the environment, but rapidly dwindling in efficacy (effectiveness) ]. MosquitoMate plans to release its insects this summer in 20 US states and Washington DC, starting with Kentucky (where the company is based).  [One drawback is that] the MosquitoMate lab techs still have to separate the male from the female lab-grown mosquitoes by hand. The process is time consuming to say the least. Considering that it must take millions of these lab mosquitoes to be released in a city in order to suppress the population of wild mosquitoes, the company will probably have to consider creating a faster more efficient way of separating the sexes. Lab-grown genetically modified mosquitoes that kill pests have already been successfully tested in other countries including China and Brazil. However, MosquitoMate hopes its GMO-free [GMO-genetically modified organism]\u00a0\u00a0solution to destroying deadly mosquitoes [is a better alternative]. \u201cUnlike traditional mosquito control, we don\u2019t show up after you have a problem,\u201d according to MosquitoMate\u2019s FAQ. \u201cBy acting proactively, your population of Asian Tiger mosquitoes will not reach a nuisance level.\u201d Reprinted here for educational purposes only. May not be reproduced on other websites without permission from CNET. Visit the website at cnet .com. NOTE:\u00a0The tiger mosquito is native to Asia. It is believed the species spread to the Western Hemisphere as a result of the international trade in used tires. The United States imports millions of tires from Asia due to the high rubber content of Asian tries, for remanufacturing purposes. Tiger mosquitoes are closely associated with used tires, which are used as sites for egg deposition and larval development. It is likely that tires imported to Houston, Texas from Japan in 1985 brought tiger mosquitoes to the United States. The trade of used tires within the U. S. has dispersed the mosquito throughout the eastern and midwestern states. (from mda.maryland.gov ) Questions 1.

When/how did the Asian tiger mosquito most likely first appear in the U.S.? 3. What is the goal of the biotech company MosquitoMate? 4. How will MosquitoMate accomplish this goal? Be specific. 5.

Background The EPA restricted the release of MosquitoMate\u2019s product, called ZAP males, to 20 states and Washington DC. The agency has previously said that those places \u201care similar in temperature and precipitation to areas where efficacy of the ZAP males was tested\u201d \u2014 Kentucky, New York and California. The EPA decision excludes much of the southeastern United States, which is home to dense populations of mosquitoes and a long mosquito season, because MosquitoMate did not conduct field trials there. MosquitoMate plans to begin selling its mosquitoes locally, in Lexington, and will expand from there to nearby cities such as Louisville, Kentucky, and Cincinnati, Ohio. The company will work with homeowners, golf courses, hotels and other customers to deploy its insects, according to Dobson. \u201cNow the work starts,\u201d he says. The company will have to start small. Suppressing the mosquito population of an entire city is likely to require the weekly production of millions of these mosquitoes. To reach that level, Dobson\u2019s company must find a way to efficiently separate male mosquitoes from females. The company\u2019s technicians now separate them both by hand and mechanically, Dobson says. Another group that is also developing mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia  to control wild populations has succeeded in producing large quantities of their insects. Researchers from Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, China, and Michigan State University in East Lansing say they are releasing 5 million Wolbachia -infected A. albopictus  each week in Guangzhou. The scientists use mechanical sorters to separate males from females, on the basis of size differences at the pupal stage, at more than 99% efficiency, says Zhiyong Xi, a medical entomologist and microbiologist at Michigan State University, who leads the project. They expose the remaining mosquitoes to X-ray radiation at a dose that sterilizes any remaining females, but is too low to affect the males.

(Photo: Associated Press) The state has previously acknowledged that noncitizen immigrants can inadvertently register to vote because of a glitch in the design of Pennsylvania\u2019s electronic driver\u2019s licensing system. That glitch has existed since the start of the state\u2019s motor voter system, Marks said, which was first authorized in 1995. The Department of State divulged the figures under pressure from Republican state lawmakers. Marks said the department has not yet determined how many other noncitizen immigrants remain registered to vote in Pennsylvania. Jump to... Questions Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by Chris Brennan, The Inquirer philly.com) \u2013 Some\u00a0of Pennsylvania\u2019s 8.4 million registered voters will cast\u00a0ballots in Tuesday\u2019s general election. How many of those registrations are held by immigrants in this country legally but ineligible to vote because they are not U.S. citizens? The Pennsylvania Department of State either does not know or will not say. It\u2019s been six weeks since Philadelphia City Commissioner Al Schmidt  went public with a problem: Since 2006, 317 Philadelphians canceled their registrations after realizing they were not eligible to vote because they are foreign citizens. The Pennsylvania Department of State  then announced it had records showing 1,160 voter registration cancellations statewide since 1972 for the same reason. That prompts three questions: How did this happen? How many illegal registrations for foreign citizens are still on the books? And how do we fix this? For answers, we are two for three. The problem was born in PennDot [Department of Transportation]  offices, where noncitizens who can legally obtain drivers licenses were also asked if they wanted to register to vote. The question created confusion, causing some to register. So far, we only know about the people who raised their hands about the problem. But each of the voter registrations that came via PennDot should be marked with an \u201cINS indicator,\u201d which notes their immigration status. Schmidt says he first met with Department of State officials in July \u2014 15 weeks ago \u2014 to discuss the problem. The Department of State says it started changing the way PennDot asks registration questions in August 2016 \u2014 14 months ago \u2014 after first reviewing the system in September 2015 \u2014 more than two years ago. By now, you would think the department would have identified all of the voter registrations tagged with INS indicators. Either they did that, but won\u2019t disclose it publicly, or they didn\u2019t do that, and should have by now. \u2026 I asked the department six weeks ago for public records about all noncitizens registered to vote, along with letters, emails, memos, and other correspondence created to address the problem. Last week, the department rejected almost all of my requests. The only document it released was a 263-page chain of emails from reporters trying to get information and the limited responses they received. This is a classic example of a public agency making a problem exponentially worse by refusing to be transparent with the people it serves. It didn\u2019t help that Secretary of State* Pedro Cortes , who rejected interview requests in September, resigned three weeks later. The department, along with Gov. Wolf\u2019s staff, would not say why that happened. [ * The most common function of secretaries of state  is to serve as the state\u2019s chief elections official (although many states also have supervisors of elections, which are usually county elected officials).] Still, the department divulged a little information. In a state House hearing last week, an official testified that 544 ballots were cast illegally \u2014 out of more than 93 million votes \u2014 in the last 18 years by noncitizens. And four out of five of the voters who should not have registered never cast a ballot. The PennDot glitch will be fixed by the end of this year, according to the department. \u2026 Reprinted here for educational purposes only.

The Speaker of the Parliament, a Shi\u2019a Muslim. The Prime Minister, a Sunni Muslim. (Compiled from reports from BBC News and by Angus McDowall ay Reuters, Nov. 4) \u2013 Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri \u00a0(a Sunni Muslim) resigned on Saturday, saying in a televised broadcast from Saudi Arabia that he feared for his life, while also fiercely criticizing Iran. He accused Iran of sowing \u201cfear and destruction\u201d in several countries, including Lebanon. Mr. Hariri\u2019s father, former Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri , was assassinated in a 2005 Beirut bomb attack that pushed his son into politics and set off years of turmoil. A U.N.-backed tribunal has charged five Hezbollah members over the killing. (The Iranian and Syrian governments are also believed to be involved in Hariri\u2019s assassination.) Mr. Hariri has been prime minister since December 2016, after previously holding the position between 2009 and 2011. \u201cWe are living in a climate similar to the atmosphere that prevailed before the assassination of [my father] martyr Rafik al-Hariri,\u201d he said in the broadcast from the Saudi capital Riyadh. \u201cI have sensed what is being plotted covertly to target my life.\u201d The Saudi-owned pan-Arab television channel al-Arabiya al-Hadath reported that an assassination plot against Hariri was foiled in Beirut days ago, citing an unnamed source. Saudi Arabia\u2019s Gulf Affairs Minister Thamer al-Sabhan said in a television interview that Hariri\u2019s personal security detail had \u201cconfirmed information\u201d of a plot to kill him. Mr. Hariri also attacked the Iran-backed Shia movement Hezbollah , which wields considerable power in Lebanon. Addressing \u201cIran and its followers\u201d he said Lebanon would \u201ccut off the hands that wickedly extend into it.\u201d Iran said the resignation would create regional tensions and rejected Mr Hariri\u2019s accusations as \u201cunfounded.\u201d It was not immediately clear who might succeed Hariri, Lebanon\u2019s most influential Sunni politician.\u00a0The prime minister must be a Sunni in Lebanon\u2019s sectarian  system.

The resignation risks exacerbating sectarian tensions between Sunni and Shi\u2018ite Muslims and returning Lebanon to paralysis in government. Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia, a political ally of Hariri, is locked in a bitter tussle for power across the Middle East with Shi\u2018ite Iran and its allies, including Hezbollah.

Background EXPLANATION OF SUNNI AND SHI\u2019A (Shi\u2019ite)\u00a0MUSLIMS Just as there are many denominations\u00a0of Christianity (such as Catholic or\u00a0Protestant) and Judaism (such as Orthodox, Conservative or Reform) there are a number of denominations\u00a0of Islam. The major\u00a0denominations\u00a0of Islam are Sunni and Shi\u2019a. Sunni and Shi\u2019a have significant theological differences from each other, but possess\u00a0the same\u00a0essential belief in Allah and the Koran. Sunnis make up the majority of Muslims worldwide (80%- 85% of all Muslims are Sunni). The Shia are a minority, comprising between 10 percent and 15 percent of the world\u2019s 1.3 billion Muslim population \u2013 certainly fewer than 200 million, all told. The Shia are concentrated in Iran, southern Iraq and southern Lebanon. But there are significant Shiite communities in Saudi Arabia and Syria, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India as well. Shi\u2019as are in the majority in Iraq (approximately 60-65% of Iraq\u2019s population are Shi\u2019a).\u00a0 Although the minority in Iraq, Sunni Arabs enjoyed favor under Saddam\u2019s rule.

It was founded in 1982 in Lebanon\u2019s Bekaa Valley by a Shia clergyman educated in Iran. Hezbollah\u2019s stated objectives include: the establishment of a Shiite theocracy in Lebanon the destruction of Israel the elimination of Western influences from the Middle East. Hezbollah is an umbrella organization of various radical Islamic Shi\u2019ite groups and organizations which receives substantial financial and philosophical support from Iran.\u00a0Hezballah is supported by Syria and is financed by Iran. On the U.S. State Department\u2019s list of terrorist organizations, Hezballah reportedly possesses an estimated 10,000 rockets capable of reaching major Israeli population centers. In 2006, Hezbollah fighters raided an Israeli border post and kidnapped two soldiers. This touched off a war between Israel and Hezbollah that lasted a month until the Israeli and Lebanese governments agreed to a cease-fire under a United Nations Security Council deal, resolution 1701. A stunning resignation (by Martin Patience, BBC News, Beirut, Nov. 4, 2017) The prime minister\u2019s resignation has opened up a chasm of uncertainty in Lebanon. It\u2019s still not clear why he announced his decision in Saudi Arabia \u2013 an extraordinary move that left even his own MPs bewildered. But the move will be seen through the lens of the great Shia-Sunni divide  that\u2019s fueling much of the violence across the Middle East. It\u2019s pitted the \u2013 with both sides backing different players to wield influence. Sunni power, Saudi Arabia, against the Shia power, Iran \u2026With this stunning resignation, many Lebanese will now fear that their country is firmly in the crosshairs of the two regional superpowers.

Jump to... Questions Background Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by Rebecca Kheel, The Hill) \u2013 U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl  will not serve any\u00a0prison\u00a0time for deserting his post in Afghanistan in 2009, a military judge ruled\u00a0Friday. The judge, Col. Jeffrey Nance , sentenced Bergdahl to a reduction in rank\u00a0to private, a payment of $1,000 per month for 10 months and a dishonorable discharge , according to multiple reports. Nance made no other comments, according to The Associated Press. [Bergdahl had chosen to be tried by a military judge instead of a jury, believing he had a better chance for a lighter sentence.] Bergdahl, 31,\u00a0pleaded guilty last month to charges of desertion  and misbehavior before the enemy . He faced a maximum sentence of life in prison. \u2026 Prosecutors had recommended a sentence of 14 years in prison. Defense attorneys, meanwhile, asked for no prison time, citing Bergdahl\u2019s time in Taliban captivity (and instead\u00a0asked the judge to give him a dishonorable discharge.) Following the sentencing, however,\u00a0Bergdahl\u2019s lead defense attorney Eugene Fidell told reporters outside the courtroom that he\u2019ll appeal the dishonorable discharge. \u201cDishonorable discharge is a lifetime stigma, and it deprives him of substantial benefits, which he badly needs,\u201d Fidell said. \u201cBeyond that, if you feel something fundamentally unfair has happened \u2013\u2013 and I am talking about President Trump\u2019s [comments] here\u2026then you appeal.\u201d Bergdahl abandoned his post in Afghanistan in 2009 and was caught and held captive by the Taliban until 2014 when President Obama made a controversial prisoner swap\u00a0[exchanging Bergdahl for five Guantanamo Bay terrorist detainees.\u00a0Bergdahl claimed he deserted his post because he wanted to travel to a larger base to report \u201ca critical problem in my chain of command,\u201d though he never specified what the problem was.] Bergdahl\u2019s defense lawyers twice tried to have the case dismissed over comments from the campaign trail, when Trump\u00a0repeatedly called Bergdahl a traitor who should be executed. \u201cWe\u2019re tired of Sgt. Bergdahl, who\u2019s a traitor, a no-good traitor, who should have been executed,\u201d Trump said at an October 2015 rally\u2026 \u201cThirty years ago, he would have been shot,\u201d he added. Nance ruled Bergdahl can get a fair trial despite Trump\u2019s comments, but said he would consider them as a mitigating*  factor in the sentencing. [*mitigating means to make less severe. The judge said he would lessen Bergdahl\u2019s sentence because of President Trump\u2019s comments] In an emotional sentencing hearing over the past week, prosecutors called soldiers who were seriously injured in the search for Bergdahl. Among those who testified was the wife of a soldier who was shot in the head and suffered a traumatic brain injury that left him unable to speak. Bergdahl also\u2026took the stand and offered a tearful apology for his decision to walk off his post\u2026.\u00a0\u201cMy words can\u2019t take away what people have been through,\u201d Bergdahl said last week. \u201cI am admitting I made a horrible mistake.\u201d  [In the beginning of the trial,\u00a0Bergdahl was the first witness called by the defense and spoke for two hours telling his side of the story, giving an unsworn statement*  that can\u2019t be cross-examined by the prosecution.

Background Definition of desertion (from wikipedia) : In military terminology, desertion is the abandonment of a duty or post without permission (a pass, liberty or leave) and is done with the intention of not returning. (In contrast, unauthorized absence (UA) or absence without leave (AWOL) refers to a temporary absence.) Penalty for desertion: In the United States, before the Civil War, deserters from the Army were flogged After 1861, tattoos or branding were also used The maximum U.S. penalty for desertion in wartime remains death, although this punishment was last applied to Eddie Slovik in 1945. No U.S. serviceman has received more than 24 months imprisonment for desertion or missing movement post-September 11, 2001. A U.S. service member who is AWOL/UA may be punished with non-judicial punishment (NJP) or by court martial under Article 86 of the UCMJ for repeat or more severe offenses. Many AWOL/UA service members are also given a discharge in lieu of court-martial. The 2012 edition of the United States Manual for Courts-Martial states that: Any person found guilty of desertion or attempt to desert shall be punished, if the offense is committed in time of war, by death or such other punishment as a court-martial may direct, but if the desertion or attempt to desert occurs at any other time, by such punishment, other than death, as a court-martial may direct. Definition of Misbehavior before the enemy  (10 U.S. Code \u00a7 899 \u2013 Art. 99) from Cornell Law School www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/899 Any member of the armed forces who before or in the presence of the enemy\u2014 (1) runs away; (2) shamefully abandons, surrenders, or delivers up any command, unit, place, or military property which it is his duty to defend; (3) through disobedience, neglect, or intentional misconduct endangers the safety of any such command, unit, place, or military property; (4) casts away his arms or ammunition; (5) is guilty of cowardly conduct; (6) quits his place of duty to plunder or pillage; (7) causes false alarms in any command, unit, or place under control of the armed forces; (8) willfully fails to do his utmost to encounter, engage, capture, or destroy any enemy troops, combatants, vessels, aircraft, or any other thing, which it is his duty so to encounter, engage, capture, or destroy; or (9) does not afford all practicable relief and assistance to any troops, combatants, vessels, or aircraft of the armed forces belonging to the United States or their allies when engaged in battle; Misbehavior before the enemy  shall be punished by death or such other punishment as a court-martial may direct.

Questions Background Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by Marisa Schultz, New York Post)\u00a0WASHINGTON \u2014 House Republicans on Thursday narrowly passed the Senate\u2019s $4 trillion budget  proposal, despite grumblings about the impact on the deficit  and the elimination of state and local tax deductions. Even with 20 Republicans joining all Democrats in voting no, the budget passed 216-212. The House had already passed its own budget that directed upcoming tax reform legislation to be deficit-neutral . (The House budget\u00a0called\u00a0for tax cuts that would not add to the federal deficit, which the Senate\u2019s bill will to do. The House version coupled the tax cuts with $200 billion in spending cuts over 10-years.) \u00a0But to speed up the process toward their ultimate goal of tax cuts, the House (gave up the spending cuts they wanted and) passed the Senate plan that would allow tax cuts to add $1.5 trillion to the deficit. \u201cBy passing this budget today, we can send a clear message to the American people: Real tax reform is on the way,\u201d said Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady  (R-Texas). The budget vote opened a process called that will allow the upcoming tax reform legislation to pass the Senate with a simple majority vote \u2014 and without any Democrats. reconciliation* ( *Reconciliation  is a legislative process that allows expedited passage of certain budgetary legislation on spending, revenues [taxes], and the federal debt limit with a simple majority vote in both the House (218 votes) and Senate (51 votes).) Democrats blasted the plan as \u201cthe billionaires\u2019 budget\u201d that will roll back Medicaid and Medicare spending to deliver tax relief to the wealthiest Americans. \u2026 Rep. Diane Black (R-Tenn.) said Democrats shouldn\u2019t make assumptions about a tax plan that hasn\u2019t even been written yet. \u2026 Republicans and President Trump believe they can deliver a massive tax cut to Americans and businesses this year that will create economic growth and deliver relief to the middle class. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make history,\u201d Black said. One major sticking point is how to pay for those tax cuts. The current plan would eliminate the deductibility of state and local taxes  to save about $1.3 trillion over the decade. (Lammakers from high-tax states were upset about this elimination and mostly voted \u201cno\u201d on the budget.) More than 44 million people rely on those deductions, especially in high-taxes states like New York, New Jersey and California. New York Republicans voting \u201cno\u201d were Dan Donovan, Claudia Tenney, Lee Zeldin, Elise Stefanik, John Katko, Peter King and John Faso. Rep. Faso said he couldn\u2019t support \u201ca budget resolution that singled out for elimination the ability of New York families to deduct state and local taxes.\u201d (Republicans will move quickly to the tax measure in hopes of passing it into law this year.

Questions Background Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by Yeganeh Torbati and Mica Rosenberg, Reuters) \u2013 The Trump administration will temporarily delay admitting refugees from 11 countries identified as high-risk, while resuming refugee admissions for other countries, government officials said on Tuesday. Most of the affected countries are in the Middle East and Africa, according to documents seen by Reuters. The administration also will place on hold a program that allows for family reunification  for some refugees resettled in the United States, according to a Trump administration memo seen by Reuters and sent to Congress on Tuesday. The resettling of so-called refugees will resume, according to the memo, once screening \u201cenhancements have been implemented.\u201d following-to-join U.S. officials said the changes were aimed at protecting U.S. national security. The changes come at the end of a 120-day hold on most refugees ordered by President Trump to allow a review of vetting processes . The 120 days ended on Tuesday, and the president issued an allowing the general resumption of the U.S. refugee program. executive order The memo expressed concerns about admitting refugees from the 11 countries and said the government will conduct a 90-day review \u201cto determine what additional safeguards, if any, are necessary to ensure \u2026 the security and welfare of the United States.\u201d A woman seeking asylum has her fingerprints taken by a U.S. Customs officer along the Mexican border in McAllen, Texas. (Photo: Carlos Barria/Reuters) Trump took office in January with a goal of sharply cutting refugee admissions, in line with promises he made during the 2016 election campaign. He quickly issued temporary bans on refugees and travelers from several Muslim-majority countries, which were challenged in court. Opponents of the bans argued that the policies were aimed at barring Muslims from the United States. (Supporters of the ban disagreed, saying that the policies are aimed at keeping Americans safe.) The administration has denied any intent to discriminate and says its travel ban and security changes are meant to protect the United States from terrorist acts. The Supreme Court on Tuesday dismissed the last remaining challenge to an earlier version of Trump\u2019s travel ban. The 11 countries to face further hurdles are those whose refugees are currently required to undergo higher-level security screening known as Security Advisory Opinions (SAOs). As of the end of 2016, SAOs were required for most adult male refugees who were nationals of Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Mali, North Korea, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, as well as Palestinians who lived in those countries, according to a State Department document seen by Reuters. Three sources familiar with refugee processing said that list was still current. Officials declined to name the 11 countries. A senior U.S. official told reporters on condition of anonymity that during the 90-day review period, refugees from the 11 countries can still be admitted to the United States on a case-by-case basis, \u201cif it\u2019s deemed to be in the national interest and they pose no threat.\u201d But the administration\u2019s memo, signed by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson , acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke  and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats , said the government will reallocate resources used to process refugees from SAO countries to those from other locations where \u201cthe processing may not be as resource intensive.\u201d \u2026 Citizens of the 11 countries comprised 44 percent of the nearly 54,000 refugees admitted into the United States in the 2017 fiscal year, according to State Department data. Of the countries, Iraq, Syria, Somalia and Iran sent by far the most refugees to the United States. All but two of the countries, North Korea and South Sudan, are majority Muslim. \u2026 The refugee program being put on hold allows refugees who have entered the United States to apply for close family members to join them. About 2,000 such refugee family members came to the United States in 2015, according to DHS data. \u201cfollow-to-join\u201d In a separate State Department memo seen by Reuters and issued this week, the administration also laid out additional screening for all refugees seeking admission into the United States, including details of their whereabouts going back a decade, twice as long as before. Refugees will also have to provide more detailed information about their family members. \u2026 (The Wall Stree Journal reported: \u201cUnder the new rules, the administration also will collect more biographical data about all applicants, such as names of family members and places of employment\u2026 The administration will also do more to mine social-media posts to see, for instance, if refugees\u2019 public pronouncements are consistent with the stories they offer in their applications, administration officials said.\u00a0The Obama administration also sought to increase vetting of social-media posts.\u201d) From Reuters .com, October 24, 2017.

Questions Background Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by David Martin, CBS News) \u2013 The nation\u2019s highest military honor was awarded Monday to retired Army Capt. Gary Michael Rose , who goes by Mike, for extraordinary acts of heroism in a secret war. During the ceremony, President Trump  said Rose\u2019s love for fellow soldiers and devotion to the country inspires us all. Rose was a in 1970 when he and 15 other Americans were sent on a top-secret mission inside Laos, which helps explain why it took so long to award him the Green Beret medic . Medal of Honor \u201cIt wasn\u2019t what we were doing,\u201d Rose said. \u201cIt was where we were doing it is really why it was classified.\u201d Laos was officially a neutral country where the U.S. military couldn\u2019t go, but the North Vietnamese were using it as a base camp from which to launch attacks into South Vietnam, so the U.S. military went in secret. All Rose was told was to bring extra medical supplies. President Trump awards retired Army Captain Gary \u201cMike\u201d Rose Medal of Honor at the White House, Oct. 23, 2017. CBS News asked Rose what [he was told] about the mission. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a tough one, and it proved to be,\u201d he said. Helicopters carried the Americans and a company of about 120 Montagnard tribesmen (Vietnamese fighters) 50 miles inside Laos. \u201cWe took two casualties going in. And we hit the ground running and it became a running gun battle for the next four days which seemed like one long day,\u201d Rose said. (No Americans were killed during that four-day battle in Laos, and there were only three fatalities overall. This mission was also a success from an operational standpoint: They came home with a trove of intelligence.\u00a0\u201cThis trove of documents gave MACV [Military Assistance Command Vietnam] its most complete understanding of this [Ho Chi Minh] trail network,\u201d said military historian Eric Villard.)

Rose) According to the citation* , Rose \u201ccontinuously exposed himself to intense fire as he fearlessly moved from casualty to casualty.\u201d He is credited with treating 60-70 wounded. (*A citation is\u00a0a note accompanying an award, describing the reasons for it.) \u201cIf I had done anything less than what I did on those four days, I would have failed myself and the guy on my left and the guy on my right,\u201d Rose said. Rose himself was hit by shrapnel in the foot and showed that the wound was almost a finger-length long. Rose was on the last chopper out and saved the life of a crewman who had been shot through the neck. \u201cHe was going into shock and I remember leaning down to him and said, \u2018Listen, you [son of a gun], if you were going to die, you\u2019d already be dead.\u2019 And he came out of shock,\u201d Rose told CBS News. Five decades later, Rose accepted the Medal of Honor on behalf of all the soldiers who fought in Laos. \u201cYou just keep putting one foot in front of the other,\u201d Rose said. \u201cThat\u2019s what you do. I mean, either that or you, you give up. Are you going to give up?\u00a0 No, you\u2019re not going to give up. \u2026 (While attending the ceremony at the White House, retired Lt. Col. Eugene McCarley , Rose\u2019s commanding officer during the battle said, \u201cMike never stopped. I know he never slept. I don\u2019t know that he ever took time to eat because from day one he had his hands full. I can\u2019t think of anyone any more deserving than Mike to receive this award. It\u2019s an effort we pushed and we fought for for many, many years, and finally it looks like it\u2019s coming to pass.\u201d) Capt. Eugene C.

Background THE MEDAL OF HONOR: The Medal of Honor \u00a0is the highest military decoration awarded by the United States government. It is bestowed by the President in the name of Congress on members of the United States Armed Forces who distinguish themselves through \u201cconspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his or her life above and beyond the call of duty while engaged in an action against an enemy of the United States.\u201d Due to the nature of its criteria, it is often awarded posthumously (more than half have been since 1941). Members of all branches of the armed forces are eligible to receive the medal, and there are three versions (one for the Army, one for the Air Force, and one for the Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard). The Medal of Honor is bestowed upon an individual by the passing of a Joint Resolution in the Congress; and is then personally presented to the recipient or, in the case of posthumous awards, to next of kin, by the President of the United States, on behalf of the Congress, representing and recognizing the gratitude of the American people as a whole. Due to its honored status, the medal is afforded special protection under U.S. law. As the award citation includes the phrase \u201cin the name of Congress\u201d, it is sometimes erroneously called the Congressional \u00a0Medal of Honor; however, the official title is simply the Medal of Honor.

SYRIA \u2013 US-backed militias declare \u2018total liberation\u2019 of Raqqa from ISIS (By Yaron Steinbuch, NY Post, Oct. 20) \u2013\u00a0After a four-month-battle, US-backed militias on Friday declared the \u201ctotal liberation\u201d of Raqqa, the de-facto capital of ISIS in Northern Syria. Talal Silo , spokesman of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) , claimed a \u201chistoric victory\u201d over the jihadists and said the extremist group had suffered a \u201cbrutal\u201d defeat, CNN reported. The SDF handed over administration of the devastated city to a council made up of local officials and tribal leaders and a 3,000-strong US-trained police force tasked with governance and security. \u201cOur victory is one against terrorism, and the liberation of Raqqa marks the latest chapter in the fight against terrorists in Syria,\u201d Silo said in a soccer stadium where ISIS militants had tortured their opponents. SDF commanders told CNN that the victory celebration was held at the stadium \u2014 to add insult to injury following the extremist group\u2019s defeat there. \u201cThe future of Raqqa will be decided by its people,\u201d he said. \u201cWe call upon all countries and peace-loving forces and all humanitarian organizations to participate in rebuilding the city and villages around it and help in removing the scars of war that were inflicted by the (IS) group.\u201d The United Nations and aid organizations estimate that about 80 percent of the city is destroyed or uninhabitable. Silo said 655 local and international fighters lost their lives fighting ISIS during the long battle. He said residents will be allowed to start returning to the city once the mines and explosives are removed. The fall of Raqqa marks a major defeat for ISIS, which has seen its territories steadily shrink since last year. The extremists took over the city, located on the Euphrates River, in January 2014, and turned it into the epicenter of its brutal rule. Kurdish-led authorities in other parts of northern Syria are already proceeding with plans to establish the federal system in areas they control, kicking off a three-phase election process last month in Kurdish majority regions, according to Reuters. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who is regaining territory with Iranian and Russian military support, has said [he] will recover control over the entire country, which has been fractured by six years of conflict. Questions 1. For Syria, give the following information: capital location/the countries that share its borders the religious breakdown of the population the type of government the chief of state (and head of government if different) If monarch or dictator, since what date has he/she ruled? \u2013 include name of heir apparent for monarch the population Find the answers\u00a0at the .\u00a0For each country, answers can be found under the \u201cGeography\u201d \u201cPeople\u201d and \u201cGovernment\u201d headings.

Background SYRIA: The city of Raqqa: Raqqa is located on the northeast bank of the Euphrates River in Syria;\u00a0the population was 220,488 in 2004 official census. During the Syrian Civil War, the city was captured in 2013 by the Syrian opposition and then by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. ISIL made the city its defacto capital in 2014. As a result, the city was hit by airstrikes from the Syrian government, Russia, the U.S. and several other countries that are part of the U.S.-led coalition (including Saudi Arabia, UAE, Jordan and France). Most non-Sunni  Muslim structures in the city were destroyed by ISIL, most notably the Shi\u2019ite Uwais al-Qarni Mosque. All Christian churches have been forcefully converted into mosques. After seizing control, ISIL terrorists executed Alawites (a small sect of Islam) and also suspected supporters of Bashar al-Assad in the city and destroyed the city\u2019s Shia mosques and Christian churches such as the Armenian Catholic Church of the Martyrs, which has since been converted into an ISIL police headquarters and an Islamic center tasked to recruit new fighters. The Christian population of Raqqa, which had been estimated to be as much as 10% of the total population (22,000 people) before the civil war began, largely fled the city\u00a0(adapted from wikipedia) What to do with captured ISIS fighters who are not Syrian (from an Associated Press report at nypost) At its height, between 27,000 and 31,000 men may have traveled to Syria and Iraq to join the Islamic State group\u2026 Of those, about 6,000 were from Europe, with most from France, Germany and Britain. (90% of these were Muslim immigrants to Europe; only 10% were\u00a0converts to Islam) As many as a third of the Europeans (native-born and naturalized citizens) may have returned home. Many are jailed immediately and awaiting trial in backlogged courts, but others are freed and under surveillance. Among the complications are how to prosecute any returnees and how to track them if and when they leave custody. No government publicly expressed concern about the fate of its citizens who left and joined the Islamic State fighters plotting attacks at home and abroad. In France, which has suffered repeated violence claimed by the Islamic State \u2014 including the Nov. 13, 2015, attacks in Paris \u2014 Defense Minister Florence Parly  was among the few to say it aloud. \u201cIf the jihadis perish in this fight, I would say that\u2019s for the best,\u201d Parly told Europe 1 radio last week. Those were the orders, according to the U.S.\u00a0Brett McGurk, the top U.S. envoy for the anti-IS coalition, in an interview with Dubai-based Al-Aan television said: \u201cOur mission is to make sure that any foreign fighter who is here, who joined ISIS from a foreign country and came into Syria, they will die here in Syria.\u00a0So if they\u2019re in Raqqa, they\u2019re going to die in Raqqa,\u201d he said. The coalition has given names and photos to the Kurdish fighters to identify the foreign jihadis, who are seen as a threat back home and a burden on their justice systems , according to a commander with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces. The commander said his U.S.-backed fighters are checking for wanted men among the dead or the few foreigners among the captured. An official with the Kurdish YPG, the backbone of the SDF that also runs the local security and intelligence branches, said foreigners who decided to fight until the end will be \u201celiminated.\u201d For the few prisoners , the Kurds try to reach out to the home countries, \u201cand we try to hand them in. But many would not want to take their (detainees),\u201d he said. No country will admit to refusing to take back citizens who joined the Islamic State, including women and their children. But few are making much of an effort to recover them. Parly said, \u201cWe cannot do anything to prevent their return besides neutralize the maximum number of jihadis in this combat,\u201d she said. Raqqa\u2019s foreign holdouts are generally acknowledged to be midlevel IS recruits, and most are believed to have little information about the group\u2019s inner workings. U.S. Col. Ryan Dillon, a spokesman for the coalition, said he had no information about any \u201chigh-value targets\u201d among approximately 350 fighters who surrendered in Raqqa in the last days, including a few foreigners. But for their home countries, they pose a risk. \u201cThe general sentiment in northern Europe is we don\u2019t want these people back, but I don\u2019t think anyone has thought about the alternatives,\u201d said Pieter Van Ostaeyen, an expert on the Belgian jihadis. Among the complications are how to prosecute any returnees and how to track them if and when they leave custody.

The thinning of forests in central Oregon has saved homes amid one of the most devastating wildfire seasons in the American West.

Questions Background Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by Chris White, The Daily Caller) \u2013 A bipartisan group of lawmakers from Western states introduced a bill Thursday allowing forest managers to thin overgrown woods that are potential tinderboxes for wildfires. Republican Sen. Michael Crapo of Idaho  and Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon  are expected to propose a compromise measure\u00a0between Republicans [who support] thinning and Democrats wary of loggers. Congress would direct the U.S. Forest Service  and Department of the Interior  to treat the areas at risk of wildfires. Forest managers would then be able to thin out the pine\u00a0forests\u00a0near\u00a0populated areas, while doing controlled burns in rural areas. Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington joined Wyden and Crapo\u2019s proposal, which also calls for evaluation reviews of any wildfire that burns more than 100,000 acres. \u201cIt\u2019s time to create new tools to reduce fire risk and help better protect our communities,\u201d\u00a0Cantwell said in a press statement\u00a0to reporters. \u201cBy targeting our most vulnerable pine forests, this science-based pilot program gives the Forest Service tools to address fire in our most vulnerable forests and prioritizes cross-laminated timber.\u201d (Republicans Jim Risch and Mike Crapo of Idaho also support the bill.\u00a0Risch, who serves on the natural resources panel, said the nation needs to \u201cactively manage our forests to reduce the fuel available for fires to burn.\u201d) The proposal came as Western wildfires\u00a0showed no sign of slowing down. Raging fires have blasted\u00a0more\u00a0than 200,000 acres in Northern California and killed at least 40 people. Similar wildfires have scorched\u00a0Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. California has also\u00a0experienced\u00a0deadly fires in the past. Wildfires barreled through the state in 1991, killing 25 people, and in 1933, killing 29. This recent spate of fires, however, has been deadlier than any other fire or group of fires in the state\u2019s history. Thousands of homes and businesses have been reduced to ash. Hundreds of people are still missing after fires swept through and leveled whole neighborhoods without warning, driven by\u00a0hurricane-force\u00a0winds.

Read the excerpt under \u201cBackground\u201d from an Oct. 13 Daily Signal report by Jarrett Stepman. Some say global warming / climate change is causing wildfires.

Background The Forest Service  within the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) manages 193 million acres of land across the United States. The agency has 28,000 employees and annual outlays of more than $7 billion. Forest Service lands are managed for multiple uses, including timber harvesting, recreation, grazing, and fish and wildlife habitats. Ways to slow the long-term trend of growing numbers of major wildfires: While some argue that climate change is to blame for the uptick in fires, it\u2019s also worth considering the drastic changes in forest management  that have occurred over the last four decades: It has been argued that these changes are driving the surge in huge fires. The U.S. Forest Service, which is tasked with managing public wildland, once had success in minimizing widespread fires in the early 20th century. But many of these successful methods were abandoned in large part because of efforts by environmental activists . In a May congressional hearing, Rep. Tom McClintock, R-Calif., said: \u201cForty-five years ago, we began imposing laws that have made the management of our forests all but impossible.\u201d He went on to say that federal authorities have done a poor job of implementing methods to reduce the number of deadly fires, and that this has been devastating for America\u2019s wildlands. \u201cTime and again, we see vivid boundaries between the young, healthy, growing forests managed by state, local, and private landholders, and the choked, dying, or burned federal forests,\u201d McClintock said. \u201cThe laws of the past 45 years have not only failed to protect the forest environment \u2014 they have done immeasurable harm to our forests.\u201d In a recent House address, McClintock pinned the blame of poor forest management on bad 1970s laws, like the and the National Environmental Policy Act . He said these laws \u201chave resulted in endlessly time-consuming and cost-prohibitive restrictions and requirements that have made the scientific management of our forests virtually impossible.\u201d Endangered Species Act Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has promoted a change to forest management policies, calling for a more aggressive approach to reduce the excess vegetation that has made the fires worse. Members of the Western Caucus  have proposed legislation to dramatically change the way forests are managed. If passed, this bill would give power back to local authorities and allow for more aggressive forest thinning without subjecting them to the most onerous of environmental reviews.\u00a0(from an Oct. 13 report by Jarrett Stepman at the conservative DailySignal \u00a0) Read a 2015 commentary \u201cDevastating Fires Show Forest Management Reforms Are Badly Needed\u201d at the libertarian reason.org .

Questions Background Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by Diana Stancy Correll, Washington Examiner and AmericanHumane .org) \u2013 Five dogs who served in the U.S. military were awarded the American Humane Lois Pope K-9 Medal of Courage \u00a0at a Capitol Hill ceremony on October 13 to recognize the canines\u2019 extraordinary valor during their time of service. \u201cBy helping locate enemy positions, engage the enemy, and sniff out deadly [improvised explosive devices] and hidden weapons, military dogs have saved countless lives in the fight for freedom and they deserve the recognition they are getting this evening,\u201d Rep. Gus Bilirakis, R-Fla., said on Wednesday, Oct. 13 on Capitol Hill during the awards ceremony. \u201cNowhere is the power of the human-animal bond more apparent than it is between our men and women in service and their faithful military dogs,\u201d he said. Four of the dogs who received the awards were present, as one has died. The recipients were: Capa, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan Alphie, who served in Afghanistan Coffee, who completed three tours in Afghanistan Ranger, who served alongside Marines in both Iraq and Afghanistan, and Gabe, who engaged in more than 200 combat missions in Iraq before passing away in 2013. \u201cSoldiers have been relying on these four-footed comrades-in-arms since the beginning of organized warfare and today military dogs are more important than ever in keeping our service men and women safe,\u201d said American Humane President and CEO Dr. Robin Ganzert said. \u201cEach dog allows so many services members to come home to be moms and dads, or sons and daughters. At American Humane\u2026we feel it is time to recognize and honor the extraordinary feats and acts of devotion these heroic animals perform every day.\u201d\u00a0American Humane has worked to assist those in the U.S. military, veterans, and military service animals for more than 100 years. The Lois Pope K-9 Medal of Courage  was created by American Humane and veterans advocate Lois Pope in 2016. Four dogs received the award in its inaugural year. \u201cThese remarkable dogs work side-by-side with the men and women of our Armed Forces, performing vitally important and life-saving work, while putting their own lives on the line for our country,\u201d said Mrs. Pope, who conceived and spearheaded the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial, which was dedicated in Washington D.C. in October 2014 as the nation\u2019s first and only permanent public tribute to the four million living disabled American veterans and all those who have died. \u201cIt is high time that [the dogs\u2019] valiant sacrifices and contributions to our nation and our men and women in uniform are properly recognized at the highest levels,\u201d Mrs. Pope noted.

Background Meet this year\u2019s medal winners: (from americanhumane.org ) Military Working Dog Coffee Most military dogs have anywhere from two to seven handlers over the course of their military careers. Coffee only had one: U.S. Army Sergeant First Class James Bennett. Coffee started and ended her military career at SFC Bennett\u2019s side. The two became partners almost a decade ago, when Coffee entered training at Lackland Air Force Base in 2006, where the Chocolate Lab learned to become a specialized explosives-detection dog. Together, Coffee and SFC Bennett served three tours of duty in Afghanistan, working together to locate lethal bombs and other security threats. Coffee faced full-on attacks and deadly ambushes by the Taliban, who specially targeted her because of her lifesaving value to our troops and the danger she posed to them, but she refused to waver. She never once failed to bring home all the soldiers she was sent to protect. Coffee supported her fellow Army comrades off the battlefield, too, boosting morale and bringing love and comfort to the brave soldiers fighting far away from home. Coffee, now 13, retired in December 2016, concluding nine-and-half-years of military service. SFC Bennett was honored to adopt his best friend and battle buddy when Coffee retired, welcoming her into his family, including his wife, Lindsay, and their three children. It was Lindsay who first encouraged SFC. Bennett to nominate Coffee for American Humane\u2019s Lois Pope LIFE K-9 Medal of Courage. Her reason? In SFC Bennett\u2019s own words, \u201cWithout Coffee, I wouldn\u2019t have come back.\u201d Explosive Detection Dog Alphie Explosive Detection Dog Alphie worked under some of the most dangerous conditions during his two tours in Afghanistan, entering and clearing villages for IEDs, making vital finds of weapons and communications equipment, and working with our warriors to surprise the Taliban and take out processing plants for illegal narcotics used to finance the war against our troops. Alphie and his handler at the time, Marine Lance Corporal William Herron, served in Helmand Province, one of the most perilous areas in the country, and Alphie had his share of close calls, being shot at numerous times, and once almost falling out of a V-22 Osprey that was part of a group of military aircraft under fire. This heroic Black Lab, now seven years old, retired from military service in 2014, but he continues to work to keep America safe here at home. Today, Alphie works as a member of the TSA\u2019s elite Canine Explosives Detection Program, together with his partner and TSA handler, Lesley Runnels. In keeping with his previous distinguished service, Runnels reports that this courageous canine is extraordinarily dedicated, never tiring in his focus and vigilance. During their three years together, the team has served in airports across the country\u2014including Chicago, New York, Orlando, Seattle, Tampa, Denver, and Fort Meyers \u2014 joining the 60,000 men and women of the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Transportation and Security Administration to fight terrorism on the home front, and tirelessly working to keep us all safe. Military Working Dog Capa Ten-year-old Military Working Dog Capa has been awarded the Navy & Marine Corps Commendation Medal for meritorious service, was deployed to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom from Japan while serving as an explosives/patrol working dog, and was tasked to provide security for four missions protecting the President of the United States, another protecting the First Lady, and yet another helping safeguard the U.S. Secretary of Defense. Capa protected literally thousands of American troops during his nine years of Navy service as a highly trained explosives-detection dog. Capa\u2019s lifesaving contributions were essential in providing safety and security for a fleet of a dozen U.S. Naval ships and 26,000 personnel, including his handler, U.S. Navy Master-at-Arms Second Class Megan Wooster. Capa\u2019s superior performance has always been the hallmark of his career and this award highlights nine years of honorable and dedicated naval service. Capa is now living in well-deserved retirement with MA2 Megan Wooster. Military Working Dog Ranger Military Working Dog Ranger saved uncounted lives\u2014and risked his own\u2014in service to our country. The eight-year-old Black Lab bravely served in Afghanistan and Iraq, where he worked as an explosives-detection dog specializing in improvised explosive devices, or IEDS\u2014the leading cause of death of American and allied troops in the War on Terror. While working, Ranger suffered heat stroke and retired from military service in 2012, finding the loving forever home he so deserves. Kirk Adams, a retired police sergeant, and his wife were proud to adopt the four-legged veteran and welcome him into their Raleigh, N.C., home. Even though Ranger is no longer on duty and is now battling cancer, Adams says his work ethic is undiminished: whenever a car comes down the driveway, whether it\u2019s a friend, neighbor or relative, Ranger is on the case and diligently checks out the vehicle for bombs. Military Working Dog Gabe (in memoriam) A true hero, Gabe was a life-saving Specialized Search Dog who served our country by completing more than 210 combat missions with 26 explosive and weapons finds in Iraq, saving countless American soldiers\u2019 lives on the battlefield.\u00a0 He passed away in the arms of his adopted Dad, Army SFC Chuck Shuck (Ret.) in Columbia, S.C, , February 13, 2013. Gabe was a pound puppy languishing in a Houston, Texasanimal shelter when he was adopted and trained by the United States Military.\u00a0 Proving beyond a doubt that adoption saves lives, Gabe began his service as a Specialized Search Dog for the United States Army in 2006 and after three years of active duty retired in 2009 having earned more than 40 awards and coins of excellence.\u00a0 He was selected as the American Kennel Club Heroic Military Working Dog in 2008, and won the top title of American Hero Dog at the annual national American Humane Hero Dog Awards \u2122 in 2012 ( youtube.com ). \u201cChuck and Gabe became part of the American Humane family,\u201d said the organization\u2019s president and CEO Dr. Robin Ganzert.\u00a0 \u201cThey were truly a perfect hero team. Their love for each other, this country, and their community was genuine. They spent almost all of their free time volunteering at local retirement homes, schools and community events bringing cheer, love, education, and compassion. \u00a0Gabe exemplified what the American Humane Hero Dog Awards are all about and I am so proud to have had the privilege of knowing them both.\u201d After receiving the top honor at the American Humane Hero Dog Awards, Gabe, a yellow Lab, and Sgt. Shuck traveled across the country as ambassadors for American Humane serving as advocates for shelter pets and promoting the importance of the human-animal bond, a bond they clearly possessed and cherished. Sgt.Shuck recently completed his Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Criminal Justice and now works as a member of the 701st Military Police Group (CID). \u00a0In an interview, Sgt.Shuck described the special bond he shared with Gabe: \u201cHe\u2019s my life. I can\u2019t sugarcoat it or sound manly about it. He\u2019s everything,\u201d he said. \u201cThe dog is with you 24/7. The dog lives with you, sleeps with you\u2026you\u2019re thousands of miles away from home, you don\u2019t have the comforts of home, and your best friend is that dog.\u201d Resources Watch a CBS news report: https://www.studentnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Retired-military-dogs-recognized_CBS.mp4 Recent Daily News Articles Veterans Day 2017: Vets Plan To Boycott NFL Games On Sunday November 10, 2017 EPA approves bacteria-infected insects to kill mosquitoes November 9, 2017 Pa. officials still mostly mum on noncitizens registered to vote November 8, 2017 Tuesday\u2019s World News #1 \u2013 Lebanon November 7, 2017 US deserter Bowe Bergdahl spared prison time November 6, 2017 Get the App Follow Us Elsewhere About  \u00a0\u2014 Site Overview  \u00a0\u2014 Contact Us  \u00a0\u2014 Donate Launched in 2005, StudentNewsDaily.com is a 501(c)3 non-profit educational website.

Questions Background Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions NOTE: Fentanyl is an opioid pain medication with a rapid onset and short duration of action. Fentanyl is 50 times stronger than heroin and 100 times stronger morphine; also, some fentanyl analogues, which are designed to mimic the pharmacological effects of the original drug, may be as much as 10,000 times stronger than morphine. (by Sarah N. Lynch, Doina Chiacu, Reuters) WASHINGTON \u2013 The U.S. Department of Justice has indicted  two major Chinese drug traffickers on charges of making illegal versions of fentanyl and selling the highly addictive drug to Americans over the internet and through international mail. \u00a0[Federal prosecutors made the announcement on Tuesday, October 16]. Xiaobing Yan , 40, and Jian Zhang , 38, who are both in China and have not been taken into U.S. custody, were charged with conspiring to distribute large quantities of fentanyl and fentanyl analogues* into the United States, the Justice Department said. (*An analogue is a drug that is chemically similar in makeup to another.) The Chinese suspects were charged in separate indictments  unsealed on Monday in Mississippi and North Dakota. \u201cFor the first time, we have indicted major Chinese fentanyl traffickers who have been using the Internet to sell fentanyl and fentanyl analogues to drug traffickers and individual customers in the United States,\u201d Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein  said in a statement. The United States does not have an extradition  agreement with China. Rosenstein said the department has talked to Chinese officials about the cases. (He said\u00a0he is hopeful the Chinese will take appropriate action with regard to properly charging the traffickers.) \u201cWe believe that most, if not all, fentanyl that is distributed here in the U.S. and in Canada, originates in China,\u201d Rosenstein said, noting that\u00a0China must do more to crack down on labs making the drugs. Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang  claimed he did not know anything about this specific case, but added that the Chinese government took the fentanyl issue seriously and was continuing to cooperate with the United States to fight the illegal production and sale of fentanyl. \u2026 Yan operated at least two chemical plants in China that were capable of illegally producing \u201cton quantities\u201d of the drugs, and evaded detection by systematically altering their chemical makeup, the Justice Department said. Investigators identified more than 100 distributors in the alleged scheme. Zhang is accused of operating at least four labs in China and selling to U.S. customers over the internet. He is accused of sending \u201cmany thousands\u201d of packages since January 2013, the government said. Five Canadians, two residents of Florida and a resident of New Jersey were also charged in connection with the alleged conspiracy involving Zhang, the department said. The United States is dealing with a major epidemic of opioid overdoses. In 2016, the Centers for Disease Control  estimated that 20,000 Americans were killed by fentanyl, a highly addictive synthetic painkiller. According to law enforcement officials, the drug is 50 times more potent than heroin and 100 times more potent than morphine. (Rosenstein said President Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions have \u201cmade it a priority for us to combat this opioid crisis,\u201d adding that the \u201cDOJ is playing a leading role in those efforts.\u201d The President\u2019s Commission on Combatting Drug Addiction and Opioid Crisis , chaired by New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, has a deadline of November 1 for its final report on the epidemic and recommendations it will pass along to the drug industry, with the objective of innovating pain management and addiction prevention measures. Prior to that deadline, President Trump implied that he would probably formally declare the opioid crisis a national emergency with an event next week. Speaking in a Rose Garden press conference with the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell on Wednesday, President Trump said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a major announcement, probably next week, on the drug crisis and on the opioid massive problem.\u201d\u00a0He added: \u201cThis country and, frankly, the world has a drug problem \u2026 and we\u2019re going to do something about it.\u201d) Additional reporting by Ben Blanchard in BEIJING From Reuters .com.

In December 2016, the Chinese government disputed the U.S.\u2019s assertion it is the top source of fentanyl. Today, the U.S. has the evidence, but the Chinese are still unwilling to act. From a Dec. 16 article: China disputes U.S. claim it\u2019s top source of synthetic drugs U.S. assertions that China is the top source of the synthetic opioids that have killed thousands of drug users in the U.S. and Canada are unsubstantiated, Chinese officials told The Associated Press. Both the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy point to China as North America\u2019s main source of fentanyl, related drugs and the chemicals used to make them. Such statements \u201clack the support of sufficient numbers of actual, confirmed cases,\u201d China\u2019s National Narcotics Control Commission told the DEA\u2019s Beijing office in a fax dated Friday. In its letter, which the commission also sent to the AP, Chinese officials urged the U.S. to provide more evidence about China\u2019s role as a source country. DEA officials said their casework and investigations consistently lead back to China. DEA data also shows that when China regulates synthetic drugs, U.S. seizures plunge. Beijing is concerned enough about international perceptions of China\u2019s role in the opioid trade that after AP published investigations highlighting the easy availability of fentanyl online from Chinese suppliers, [China\u2019s] Narcotics Commission made a rare invitation to a team of AP journalists to discuss the issue at the [Communist government\u2019s] powerful Ministry of Public Security\u2026in Beijing. a) What can the Trump administration do to force China to crack down / eliminate the production of fentanyl in China? b) Ask a parent the same question.

Read \u201c Police officer accidentally overdoses on fentanyl after making drug arrest \u201c History/uses of fentanyl: Fentanyl was first made by Belgian physician Paul Janssen in 1960. Janssen developed fentanyl by testing chemicals similar in structure to pethidine(meperidine) for opioid activity. The widespread use of fentanyl triggered the production of fentanyl citrate (the salt formed by combining fentanyl and citric acid in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio),\u00a0which entered medical use as a general anaesthetic under the trade name Sublimaze in the 1960s. In the mid-1990s, fentanyl was introduced for palliative (end of life)  use with the fentanyl patch, followed in the next decade by the introduction of the fentanyl lollipop, dissolving tablets, and sublingual spray which are absorbed through the tissues inside the mouth. As of 2012, fentanyl was the most widely used synthetic opioid  in medicine. In 2013, 1,700 kilograms (3,750 lbs) were used globally. Fentanyl has a relatively wide therapeutic index (270) which makes it a very safe surgical anaesthetic when monitored carefully; however, its potency requires careful measurements of highly diluted fentanyl in solution. Fentanyl patches are on the World Health Organization\u2019s List of Essential Medicines, the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system. Fentanyl is illegally made and used as a recreational drug often disguised as other medications or mixed with heroin, leading to thousands of overdose deaths from 2000 to 2017. \u00a0Deaths have also resulted from improper medical use. (from wikipedia) Opioids  are painkillers.\u00a0There are a number of classes of opioids. Three of these classes, natural \u00a0opiates, semi-synthetic \u00a0opioids, and synthetic \u00a0opioids are commonly referred to as narcotic, or painkilling opioid drugs: The naturally occurring opiates are those which are found in the opium resin of the opium poppy. Although there are over 25 different alkaloids present in opium,\u00a0morphine\u00a0and\u00a0codeine\u00a0are the only two that are used as narcotic opiate analgesics. All other opioid analgesic medications are either semi- or fully-synthetic and are not found in nature. The semi-synthetic opioids  such as\u00a0hydrocodone,\u00a0hydromorphone,\u00a0oxycodone, and\u00a0oxymorphone\u00a0are derived from the naturally occurring opiates and opium alkaloids (morphine and thebaine especially). Fully- synthetic opioids  such as\u00a0methadone and\u00a0fentanyl\u00a0are synthesized from other chemicals and molecules that do not come from alkaloids found in opium.

Questions Background Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (from CBS Los Angeles)  \u2013 The civilian panel that oversees the Los Angeles Police Department approved a drone pilot program Tuesday \u2014 several months after the department first presented what it called a limited plan to use the technology. Approval of the program by the Los Angeles Board of Police Commissioners  came despite opposition from activists who consider the technology a threat to civil liberties  and after only 6 percent of the 1,675 emails the LAPD received about the program expressed support for it. During the meeting, several anti-drone protesters blocked traffic outside LAPD headquarters. Just before 1 p.m., officers cleared the intersection and cited some of the protesters for unlawful assembly. The board held a meeting two weeks ago, when it approved the guidelines for the 1-year pilot program. Now, after posting the on the department\u2019s website for two weeks and receiving more public feedback, the board voted on its final approval. guidelines The commission first heard a presentation on the guidelines for the proposed LAPD program in August, and the department held four public meetings to get feedback. Commissioner Cynthia McClain-Hill voted against the program Tuesday, while Commission President Steve Soboroff, Vice President Matthew Johnson and Commissioner Sandra Figueroa-Villa voted for it. Commissioner Shane Murphy Goldsmith was not present for the vote. A pair of Draganflyer X6 drones were given to the LAPD by Seattle in 2014, but they have never been deployed. Police Chief Charlie Beck  said at the time that the drones could be used during tactical events such as manhunts and standoffs. But he also said the department planned to work closely with the American Civil Liberties Union to ensure the drones would not infringe on individual privacy rights . The LAPD\u2019s pursuit of a pilot program is a reversal of its policy after it abandoned the idea of using drones three years ago in the face of protests from activists. According to the guidelines the LAPD commission approved, drones would be used in a limited capacity, including high-risk tactical operations, barricaded armed suspect responses, hostage rescues, and situations involving threats of exposure to hazardous materials and the need to detect explosive devices. The drones will not be weaponized or used during surveillance , and their use will have be approved on a case-by-case basis. The Los Angeles City Council cleared the way in June for the city\u2019s fire department to begin using drones. A Los Angeles Fire Department report addressed the issue of privacy concerns and said the devices would not be used to monitor or provide surveillance for law enforcement. In July, the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department Civilian Oversight Commission  voted 5-4 to call for the grounding of the LASD\u2019s drone program, although Sheriff Jim McDonnell said the program would continue. Members of the Stop LAPD Spying Coalition,  the Drone-Free LAPD/No Drones, LA! Campaign,  the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California  and other civil rights organizations have been vocal about their opposition to the program over concerns of \u201cmission creep\u201d [the idea that police would steadily, quietly expand use of the devices \u2013 that they would\u00a0be armed or used for surveillance to infringe on privacy rights..] Reprinted here from CBS Los Angeles for educational purposes only.

Background from an Oct. 3 Los Angeles Times article : If approved, drones \u2014 referred to by the LAPD as small Unmanned Aerial System  \u2014 will be flown only during specific incidents involving barricaded suspects, active shooters, potential explosives, hostages, natural disasters, hazardous materials, search and rescue operations, and in searches for armed criminals. Each flight must be approved by a commander on scene as well as a deputy chief. An assistant chief, the police chief and two police commissioners would also be notified. The drones \u201cshall not be deployed or used in violation of the law or Constitution,\u201d the guidelines said, meaning police would still need to get search warrants if necessary. The guidelines call for the LAPD to document and review requests for using drones, whether they are flown. Each request will be logged and forwarded to department higher-ups and two police commissioners, as will monthly inspections and quarterly reports. At the end of the yearlong pilot, a full report will be presented to the Police Commission, which will then decide whether to continue using the devices.

Jump to... Questions Background Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (from CBS News) AP \u2013\u00a0Terrorist bomber Ahmad Khan Rahimi  was found guilty on Monday of detonating a shrapnel-packed explosive device that injured 30 people on a terrifying night on New York City streets in 2016. The verdict by the\u00a0Manhattan Federal Court jury came after a two-week trial of 29-year-old Rahimi, an Afghanistan-born man living in Elizabeth, NJ. The charges, including using a weapon of mass destruction and bombing a public place, carry a maximum punishment of life in prison.\u00a0Sentencing is scheduled for Jan. 18. (The first day of Rahimi\u2019s trial was delayed for about 40 minutes after he first refused to enter the courtroom \u2014 and then, once inside, ignored Manhattan Federal Judge Richard Berman\u2019s instruction to sit down and remain silent.) Prosecutors said Rahimi considered himself \u201ca soldier in a holy war against Americans\u201d and was inspired by the Islamic State group and al-Qaida to carry out the attacks in New York and New Jersey and was\u00a0intent on inflicting as much carnage as possible with his homemade pressure cooker bombs. \u201cHe designed it,\u201d said Assistant U.S. Attorney Shawn Crowley  in her opening argument. \u201cHe built it. He filled it with explosives and deadly shrapnel, and he planted it on the street.\u201d He was found guilty of all eight charges against him. The defense said it will appeal. In his closing argument, Assistant U.S. Attorney Emil Bove  described an unusually large amount of evidence that pointed to Rahimi. His fingerprints and DNA were found on bombs in the Sept. 17, 2016, attacks. Dozens of videos tracked his movements as he dragged the bombs in suitcases through Manhattan streets, and they also captured the explosion at 23rd Street in the Chelsea neighborhood that injured 30 people. The second bomb didn\u2019t detonate. As a bomb squad investigator testified, prosecutors showed jurors a mangled, waist-high trash bin that was sent flying 120 feet across a busy street by the bomb. The government called it a miracle that nobody was killed by the explosive, which scattered ball bearings meant to serve as shrapnel. If that wasn\u2019t enough, Bove said, jurors could look at a small notebook that was on Rahimi when he was arrested two days after the attack following a shootout with police in New Jersey. The prosecutor said Rahimi\u2019s written words provided a confession as he took responsibility for the bombings in a \u201cclaim of credit\u201d for attacks that left him feeling proud. He still faces charges in New Jersey related to the shootout. He has pleaded not guilty to attempted murder of police officers. Assistant public defender Sabrina Shroff  did not deny evidence linking Rahimi to the 23rd Street bomb but asked jurors to question whether Rahimi really intended for the 27th Street bomb to go off. She urged the jury to acquit Rahimi of three charges that could result in a mandatory life prison sentence. And she expressed compassion for those injured by the blast, some of whom testified during the trial. \u201cThis is a difficult case for all of us because we are all New Yorkers,\u201d Shroff said. Prosecutors said Rahimi left his home before sunrise to plant a pipe bomb along the route of a Marine Corps charity race in Seaside Heights, New Jersey, an oceanside community. No one was injured in the explosion because the race had been delayed. It was then canceled. Hours later, Rahimi went into Manhattan, where he was seen walking from Penn Station to the street locations where two bombs were placed. The first bomb, hidden near a large trash bin, set off a blast that sent the 100-pound dumpster into the air, shattered windows, scattered bits of metal and caused people on the street to scream and flee the area. A bomb at 27th Street was discovered and deactivated before it could explode. The following day, a homeless man and his friend alerted authorities after they found a backpack containing smaller bombs in a trash can near a train station in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew DeFilippis  said in closing arguments that Rahimi had carried out a \u201ccold and calculating\u201d attack with a variety of explosive devices that included a backpack filled with seven bombs, some small enough to use like hand grenades. The prosecutor said Rahimi could be convicted even if some bombs didn\u2019t explode because the government only needed to prove that he took \u201csubstantial steps\u201d to set off explosives. Alluding to the numerous street videos jurors watched of Rahimi walking through Manhattan, DeFillipis reminded jurors that they had seen him take \u201cstep after step after step,\u201d including after the 23rd Street bomb exploded. He said Rahimi was seen \u201cwalking away so he wouldn\u2019t get hurt while others bled.\u201d  [Rahimi was arrested two days after the explosion after a shootout with police in Linden, N.J., where two officers were wounded when he shot them. \u00a0He was hit seven times by return fire. He still faces attempted murder charges in New Jersey for the gunfight preceding his arrest.] Reprinted here for educational purposes only.

Background Rahami was born in Afghanistan in 1988 and first came to the United States in 1995, several years after his father arrived seeking asylum, a law enforcement official said. He became a naturalized citizen in 2011. Rahami majored in criminal justice at Middlesex County College in Edison, New Jersey, school spokesman Tom Peterson said. Rahami attended from 2010-2012 but did not graduate. Rahimi is a naturalized U.S. citizen . Foreign nationals who wish to become citizens of the U.S. may do so through the naturalization process. Citizenship confers many advantages \u2014 the right to vote, protection from the government, access to certain jobs and benefits, and the option to hold public office (with the exception of President). Included in the requirements to become a Naturalized Citizen: Good Moral Character A naturalization applicant must show good moral character during the five-year period prior to application (three years if married to a U.S. citizen or one year for certain military exceptions). Murder convictions are a permanent obstacle to naturalization, as are aggravated felony convictions.\u00a0Certain criminal convictions in the five years prior to the application will bar naturalization. Attachment to the Constitution An application for naturalization must declare the applicant\u2019s willingness to support and defend the U.S. and the Constitution. An applicant declares his or her \u201cattachment\u201d to the U.S. and the Constitution at the time he or she takes the oath of allegiance. The New York Daily News reports: A delay in the beginning of the Marines\u2019 race in NJ spared all runners from injury. The bomb exploded as participants waited at the starting line. Authorities said Rahimi also planted a bomb on W. 27th St. in Manhattan, which police discovered before it detonated. The third bomb, left on busy W. 23rd St. in Chelsea, Manhattan blew up around 8:30 p.m., injuring 30 bystanders. \u201cThe fact that victims were not killed when one bomb exploded and another failed to detonate is miraculous,\u201d NYPD Commissioner James O\u2019Neill said.

In a January , President Trump called for a wall be built along the United States\u2019 border with Mexico to executive order \u201cprevent illegal immigration, drug and human trafficking and acts of terrorism.\u201d Six companies were selected to build eight prototypes. Construction began last month, with crews given 30 days to complete their models. Each prototype will be between 18 and 30 feet tall and are designed to \u201cdeter illegal crossings in the area,\u201d officials said. Four models are made of concrete and four are made from other materials. The construction site is located near the .\u00a0 ( Otay Mesa Port of Entry* *The  ) Otay Mesa Port of Entry  is one of three ports of entry (POE) in the San Diego\u2013Tijuana metropolitan region, connecting Otay Mesa in the City of San Diego with the Otay Centenario borough of Tijuana. Once complete, the government will run a series of tests on each prototype, checking for anti-climbing, anti-breaching, and anti-digging capabilities, among other things. \u201cWe are committed to securing our border and that includes constructing border walls. Our multi-pronged strategy to ensure the safety and security of the American people includes barriers, infrastructure, technology and people,\u201d Ron Vitiello, acting U.S. Customs and Border Protection deputy commissioner , said in a release. \u201cMoving forward with the prototypes enables us to continue to incorporate all the tools necessary to secure our border.\u201d On Thursday News 8 got a chance to see five of the prototypes up close. Border Patrol agents took News 8\u2019s Steve Price to a fenced-off area in where crews are halfway into the 30 days they have to build their prototype for what will eventually be a 2,000-mile long wall along our southern border. Otay Mesa One wall has razor wire across the top; another bollard-style fencing that\u2019s friendlier to wildlife; all are designed to be tough to climb or penetrate. \u201cIt\u2019s very interesting to see all the different types of ideas and wall prototypes,\u201d said U.S. Border Patrol Agent Tekae Michael . \u201cIn a wall, what we would want is anything that\u2019s going to protect us and protect the United States.\u201d Three more wall prototypes are coming and once completed they\u2019ll be put to the test. \u201cThere will be a testing and an evaluation process and we\u2019re going to look to see if the wall prototypes meet the anti-scaling, anti-climbing, anti-digging and safety of border patrol agents,\u201d said Agent Michael. San Diego\u2019s southern border spans 60 miles right now with 46 miles protected by an 8 \u2013 10-foot primary fence that\u2019s over 25 years old. A 20-year-old secondary fence overlaps the primary fence for 13 miles, in areas more popular with [those attempting to enter the U.S. illegally]. \u201cWhat we do have with our primary and secondary fencing has proven to be effective but like anything, in age, everything needs an upgrade,\u201d said Agent Michael. Bids for the prototypes range from $300,000 to $500,000. As of now, the building of an actual wall lacks congressional funding. Both the state of California and San Diego County have voiced opposition to the construction of a wall along the border. Last month, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra  filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over its border wall plan, citing legal and constitutional violations. San Diego City Council voted 5-3 in September to pass a resolution opposing the border wall, saying it would be detrimental to San Diego\u2019s environment and tourism and accomplishes nothing. The many Americans who want a wall constructed to prevent people from entering the country illegally support the construction that is going forward as promised.

Background Securing our southern border with the construction of a wall was one of the key promises Donald Trump made when campaigning for president. The following is from the\u00a0Executive Order he signed in January soon after being inaugurated: Executive Order: Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements Purpose. \u00a0 Border security is critically important to the national security of the United States.\u00a0 Aliens who illegally enter the United States without inspection or admission present a significant threat to national security and public safety.\u00a0 Such aliens have not been identified or inspected by Federal immigration officers to determine their admissibility to the United States.\u00a0 The recent surge of illegal immigration at the southern border with Mexico has placed a significant strain on Federal resources and overwhelmed agencies charged with border security and immigration enforcement, as well as the local communities into which many of the aliens are placed. Transnational criminal organizations operate sophisticated drug- and human-trafficking networks and smuggling operations on both sides of the southern border, contributing to a significant increase in violent crime and United States deaths from dangerous drugs.\u00a0 Among those who illegally enter are those who seek to harm Americans through acts of terror or criminal conduct.\u00a0 Continued illegal immigration presents a clear and present danger to the interests of the United States. Federal immigration law both imposes the responsibility and provides the means for the Federal Government, in cooperation with border States, to secure the Nation\u2019s southern border.\u00a0 Although Federal immigration law provides a robust framework for Federal-State partnership in enforcing our immigration laws \u2013 and the Congress has authorized and provided appropriations [funding; money] \u00a0to secure our borders \u2013\u00a0the Federal Government has failed to discharge this basic sovereign  responsibility.\u00a0 The purpose of this order is to direct executive departments and agencies (agencies) to deploy all lawful means to secure the Nation\u2019s southern border, to prevent further illegal immigration into the United States, and to repatriate illegal aliens swiftly, consistently, and humanely.

Jump to... Questions Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (Compiled from articles by Katherine Lam at Fox News and Natalie O\u2019Neille at NY Post) \u2013 The future of Shake Shack doesn\u2019t involve human cashiers. The popular burger chain announced on Monday that its newest New York City location will be cashless and kiosk-only. The chain plans to use the Astor Place branch as a testing ground for the cashless kiosk model, which eliminates the job of cashier. It also gets rid of its traditional order placing area.\u00a0Customers at the Astor Place location will be ordering their food using an app or the touchscreen kiosks and paying with credit cards only.\u00a0Buzzers at the burger joint, which was founded by famed restaurateur Danny Meyer, will be replaced by text messages to alert diners when their food is ready. \u201cWe\u2019re really viewing this as an evolution of the guest experience aimed at enhancing hospitality,\u201d Kristyn Clark, Shake Shack\u2019s senior manager of brand communications, told Fox News. \u201cThe Shack kiosk was developed to allow Shake Shack to serve more guests at peak times \u2013 whether in-Shack, for pickup via the Shack App, or even delivery \u2013 resulting in fewer lines, less wait time and quicker speed of service at every channel. It\u2019s a guest-centric approach,\u201d she added. The idea is that instead of spending time waiting in line, customers will now be able to leisurely walk through the restaurant and spot open seats while they wait. The orders will be ready at the counter. The restaurant won\u2019t be completely staff-free. Workers will guide diners at the kiosks and work through potential tech glitches. The new set up will be a test run for the chain, who boasts about its $15 minimum wage at its New York, California and Washington, D.C., locations. \u201cThe Astor Place Shack will be a playground where we can test and learn the ever-shifting needs of our guests,\u201d the chain\u2019s CEO Randy Garutti said in a news release. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to lead with kiosk-only ordering, putting control of the Shake Shack experience in our guests\u2019 hands, and an optimized kitchen with increased capacity for mobile orders and eventual delivery integration to support ongoing digital innovation.\u201d Clark told Fox News the kiosks are not meant to replace human workers, but to \u201cprovide greater hospitality.\u201d The Astor Place location is expected to open this month. Shake Shack isn\u2019t the only restaurant chain that has recently gone cashless.\u00a0Sweetgreen, a fast-casual salad chain with locations in Manhattan, stopped accepting cash earlier this year. Opting for touch-screen kiosks at its newest location in Manhattan\u2019s East Village, as opposed to hiring human cashiers is a change from founder Danny Meyer\u2019s statement last year when he said,\u00a0\u201cI know there is a temptation to replace human beings with robots or with iPads. We want you to leave there just skipping with delight, and so far we haven\u2019t found anything that does that better, either in terms of the food or the hospitality, than people.\u201d  [NY Business Journal reported in February, \u201cThe decision coincides with a trend where both fast-casual chains and fast-food venues alike have been embracing a new kind of automated restaurant with lower labor costs because they require fewer staff \u2014 even though their marketing materials say there will be a lot of hiring done. McDonald\u2019s recently took a similar cue in New York beginning with a Midtown Manhattan location on 6th Avenue.\u201d] Originally published at foxnews .com on October 3, 2017.

Questions Background Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by Jack Moore, Newsweek) \u2013 The U.S. government has issued a $12 million bounty for information leading to the capture of two senior leaders of the Lebanese Shiite [Islamic] militant group Hezbollah who are believed to be plotting attacks on U.S. soil. Washington is offering $7 million for information that leads to the arrest of and $5 million for Talal Hamiyah . Fu\u2019ad Shukr \u201cIt is our assessment that Hezbollah is determined to give itself a potential homeland option as a critical component of its terrorism playbook,\u201d Nicholas Rasmussen, director of the National Counterterrorism Center, said in a briefing Tuesday. U.S. State Department wanted sign for Hamiyah and Shukr. Hamiyah is the leader of Hezbollah\u2019s \u201cinternational terrorism branch,\u201d a figure with ties to attacks and kidnap plots against Americans, the State Department said. Shukr is a general for Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, where it shares a border with Israel, a U.S. ally that the militant force considers its archenemy. He has also played a role in Hezbollah\u2019s operations in Syria. This is the first U.S.-issued bounty for Hezbollah leaders in more than a decade. A Hezbollah official told the Associated Press on Wednesday\u00a0the move is part of Washington\u2019s effort to \u201cdemonize\u201d the group. The official said the new measures would not hamper the group\u2019s activities in the Middle East. \u201cIt is part of the continuous efforts to demonize Hezbollah. They are false accusations that will not have any effect on the operational activities of Hezbollah,\u201d the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Hezbollah is a proxy  of the Iranian government, which funds and arms the group to boost its strength in both Lebanon and Syria, where it is fighting in support of the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in the six-year civil war. The decision to place a financial bounty on the two leaders comes as [newly elected president Donald Trump is implementing a much stronger U.S. policy than previous presidents against the agressive] Iranian regime and its activities both at home and abroad. He has for months taken aim at the landmark? nuclear deal signed between Tehran and world powers in July 2015, threatening to tear up the agreement that was reached after years of negotiating by\u00a0the international community. [Although a majority of Americans opposed the deal with Iran, President Obama bypassed Congress and signed an executive order in January 2016 which ended the 20-years of sanctions against\u00a0Iran for pursuing a nuclear weapons program. Then, in August 2016, the Obama administration secretly arranged a delivery of $400 million in cash to Iran on an unmarked plane on the same day Iran released four American hostages.] Reprinted here for educational purposes only.

Background ON HEZBOLLAH: Hezbollah, whose name means \u201cparty of Allah,\u201d is a terrorist group believed responsible for nearly 200 attacks since 1982 that have killed more than 800 people.\u00a0\u00a0It was founded in 1982 in Lebanon\u2019s Bekaa Valley by a Shia clergyman educated in Iran.\u00a0 Hezbollah\u2019s stated objectives include: the establishment of a Shiite theocracy in Lebanon the destruction of Israel the elimination of Western influences from the Middle East Hezbollah is\u00a0an umbrella organization of various radical Islamic Shi\u2019ite groups and organizations which receives substantial financial and philosophical support from Iran. In 2006, Hezbollah fighters raided an Israeli border post and kidnapped two soldiers.\u00a0 This touched off a war between Israel and Hezbollah that lasted a month until the Israeli and Lebanese governments agreed to a cease-fire under a United Nations Security Council deal, resolution 1701.\u00a0 Resolution 1701 calls for the \u201cfull cessation of hostilities\u201d between Hezbollah and Israel. It sketches a plan for the phased withdrawal of Israeli forces from southern Lebanon and calls for an expanded peacekeeping force there (of 15,000 U.N. troops). PARTIAL LIST OF SOME OF THE AMERICANS MURDERED BY HEZBOLLAH \u00a0from a 2012 \u00a0Wall Street Journal article by\u00a0Bret Stephens: 17 Americans killed in April 1983 at the U.S. Embassy in Beirut [Lebanon] by the Iranian-backed Islamic Jihad  Organization, later known as Hezbollah. 241 U.S. servicemen killed by Islamic Jihad  at the Marine barracks in Beirut  on Oct. 23, 1983. Master Chief Robert Dean Stethem, beaten to death in June 1985 by a Hezbollah terrorist in Beirut aboard TWA flight 847. William Francis Buckley, the CIA station chief in Beirut, tortured to death by Hezbollah that same month (June 1985). Marine Col. William Higgins, taken hostage in 1988 while serving with U.N. peacekeepers in Lebanon and hanged by Hezbollah sometime later. The 19 U.S. Air Force personnel killed in June 1996 in the Khobar Towers [Saudi Arabia] bombing, for which several members of Saudi Hezbollah were indicted in U.S. federal court. Bret Stephens also wrote: \u201cSensible policy on Iran begins not with the question of how to avoid a war\u2014that war was foisted on us in 1979\u2014but how to win it.

Questions Background Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions is the technical field of using microscopes to view objects and areas of objects that cannot be seen with the naked eye. There are three well-known branches of microscopy: optical, electron, and scanning probe microscopy. (wikipedia) Microscopy is a microscopy technique in which a beam of electrons is transmitted through a specimen to form an image. The specimen is most often an ultrathin section less than 100 nm thick..An image is formed from the interaction of the electrons with the sample as the beam is transmitted through the specimen. The image is then magnified and focused onto an imaging device\u2026Transmission electron microscopes are capable of imaging at a significantly higher resolution than light microscopes (from wikipedia) Transmission electron microscopy is a form of transmission electron microscopy where the sample is studied at cryogenic temperatures (generally liquid-nitrogen temperatures) (wikipedia) \u00a0It is an electron microscopic technique that involves freezing the biological sample in order to view the sample with the least possible distortion. The advantages of cryo-EM over traditional EM techniques include the preservation of the sample in a near-native hydrated state without the distortions from stains or fixatives needed for traditional EM. (medicinenet .com) Cryo-electron microscopy (by Simon Johnson, Ben Hirschler, Reuters) \u2013 STOCKHOLM/LONDON \u2013 A trio of Swiss, American and British scientists won the 2017 Nobel chemistry prize on Wednesday, October 4 for developing , allowing researchers to see biological molecules frozen in action. cryo-electron microscopy The work by Jacques Dubochet, Joachim Frank  and Richard Henderson  makes it possible to image proteins  and other molecules  after freezing them rapidly to preserve their shape, providing a powerful new tool for medical research. \u201cIt\u2019s like frames in a movie. Each of these pictures represents a frame and they can be put together into a movie and we can see what the molecules do,\u201d said Peter Brzezinski, a member of the Nobel committee for chemistry. The new approach fills a previously blank space by generating images [making pictures]  of everything from the surface of the Zika virus to proteins that cause antibiotic resistance or are involved in Alzheimer\u2018s. From left: Scientists Jacques Dubochet, Joachim Frank and Richard Henderson have won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for developing cryo-electron microscopy. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awarded the 9 million Swedish crown ($1.1 million) prize, said the technology had moved biochemistry  into a new era. By freezing biomolecules  mid-movement, scientists can unravel previously unseen processes \u2013 a major advance both for basic understanding and the potential development of new drugs. Scottish-born scientist Henderson used an to generate a three-dimensional image of a protein at an electron microscope atomic resolution [very clear picture with a lot of detail] , showing the potential of the technology. Until then, electron microscopes were only seen as suitable for imaging dead matter, because the powerful electron beam destroyed the biological material. His breakthrough was further developed by German-born scientist Frank, a U.S. citizen, while Dubochet of Switzerland used rapidly frozen water to preserve the natural shape of the biomolecules. Frank said cryo-electron microscopy  had \u201cimmense\u201d potential for medical research, which is increasingly focused on processes inside cells, but it would take time for this to play out \u2013 and he was taken aback by news of the award. \u201cI was overwhelmed. I thought the chances of winning a Nobel prize were miniscule,\u201d he told a news briefing by telephone. Henderson was equally taken aback and said he had rejected the first phone call from the Swedish academy on Wednesday before picking up second time. \u201cThe three of us who have been awarded the prize are sort of acting on behalf of the whole field,\u201d he told a news conference in Cambridge, England. Understanding the structure of proteins and working out how they interact in the body should spark fresh approaches to drug development, just as earlier advances had produced today\u2019s multibillion-dollar biotech  drugs, he added. * ( Biotech is short for biotechnology:\u00a0the use of living cells, bacteria, etc., to make useful products \u2013 such as crops that insects are less likely to destroy or new kinds of medicine.) * \u201cIn a few years, maybe five years, we might know most of the structures \u2026 it\u2019s quite an exciting time,\u201d Henderson said. Indeed, cryo-electron microscopy  is already delivering results, such as the recent discovery of the structure of tau protein filaments in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. It was also put to work last year in the fight against Zika, when the mosquito-borne virus was linked to an epidemic of brain-damaged babies in Brazil. As alarm about the outbreak spread, scientists were able to generate three-dimensional images of Zika at the atomic level, jump-starting the search for potential drugs and vaccines. \u201cThe use of these methods has completely revolutionized structural biology  so everyone now wants to buy this type of equipment and start this type of research, all over the world,\u201d Johan Aqvist, another Nobel committee member, told Reuters. U.S.-based Thermo Fisher Scientific is a leading supplier of cryo-electron microscopy instruments . Chemistry is the third of this year\u2019s Nobel Prizes after the winners of the medicine and physics prizes were announced earlier [last] week. \u2026 Additional reporting by Niklas Pollard, Anna Ringstrom, Johan Ahlander, Helena Soderpalm and Johannes Hellstrom; editing by Justyna Pawlak/Jeremy Gaunt From Reuters .com, October 4, 2017.

Background Why this research is so transformative  ( businessinsider.com ) In order to understand something \u2014 even\u00a0if it\u2019s microscopic and invisible, like a protein or a virus \u2014 you need to know what it looks like. A recently developed technique called cryo-electron microscopy  creates 3D visualizations of biological molecules like proteins, DNA, and RNA, making them visible in ways previously thought impossible. Three scientists \u2014 Jacques Dubochet, Joachim Frank, and Richard Henderson \u2014 were awarded the 2017 Nobel prize in chemistry Wednesday for their work developing\u00a0the method, which has\u00a0given\u00a0scientists an unprecedented look at what the Nobel prize committee\u00a0described\u00a0as \u201clife\u2019s molecular machinery.\u201d Being able to see the twists, turns, and shapes of molecules can reveal what types of drugs\u00a0could help treat a virus or\u00a0which medical molecule\u00a0might fight a certain type of cancer. Just\u00a0looking at these structures has filled in scientific knowledge gaps that existed for years. Electron microscopy  refers to the act of sending a beam of electrons at a small sample of a material. Unlike normal microscopes, which use light, beams of electrons can illuminate the tiniest of details in a structure, down the location of individual atoms. The technique\u00a0has existed since the 1930s,\u00a0but many scientists didn\u2019t\u00a0think it could be used\u00a0to look at biomolecules  for\u00a0two main reasons. First, the force of the electron beam\u00a0blasts biological material apart. Weakening the beam enough to keep molecules intact only creates\u00a0a low-contrast, fuzzy image. Second, electron microscopes can\u2019t be used on anything that\u2019s in water, since the process evaporates that water. And without water\u00a0(a main component of all cells), biological molecules collapse. In 1975, Richard Henderson , a molecular biologist who heads up a lab at Cambridge in the UK, used a weakened electron beam to capture a poor-contrast image of a protein. The protein was protected by a membrane, so didn\u2019t need to be kept in water. He and colleagues\u00a0gathered\u00a0images from a number of angles, then used a mathematical model to create the best picture yet of a protein generated with an electron microscope.\u00a0But\u00a0the image didn\u2019t yet have the resolution Henderson wanted. Meanwhile, Joachim Frank , a Columbia University professor\u00a0originally from Germany, was working on ways to process the flat 2D images taken by electron microscopes. In the years between 1975 and 1986, he came up with a way to process a number of those fuzzy, flat images and turn them into sharper 3D models. The 3D versions could reveal the structure of a protein, advancing the technique Henderson had previously used. In the 1980s, Swiss biophysicist Jacques Dubochet \u00a0set to work solving another problem that was keeping scientists from creating images and models of biomolecules. He developed a way to \u201cvitrify\u201d water by cooling it so rapidly that it became a solid in its liquid form (without forming ice crystals). Essentially, he turned it into glass. Put together, these\u00a0developments set the stage for what would become known as cryo-electron microscopy, with \u201ccryo\u201d being the prefix for \u201ccold.\u201d Richard Henderson\u2019s 1975 rough model of bacteriorhodopsin. Henderson\u2019s 1990 cryo-electron microscopy image of bacteriorhodopsin was far more detailed. THE NOBEL PRIZE The prizes are named after Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite, and have been awarded every year since 1901 in accordance with his will for achievements in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature and for peace. The Nobel Prize is an international award administered by the Nobel Foundation in Stockholm, Sweden. In 1968, Sveriges Riksbank established The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, founder of the Nobel Prize. Each prize consists of a medal, personal diploma, and a cash award. The prizes are always handed out in ceremonies on Dec. 10, the date that prize founder Alfred Nobel died in 1896.

(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) Jump to... Questions Background Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions From an October 9, 2017, 2:20 p.m. report: (by Sonali Kohli , Javier Panzar , Paige St. John and Dakota Smith, Los Angeles Times) \u2013\u00a0 One person has died and at least 1,500 homes, businesses and other structures have been destroyed as more than 14 fires ravaged eight counties throughout Northern California on Monday, authorities said. The death was related to the Redwood Valley fire in Mendocino County, according to the Mendocino County coroner\u2019s office. The vast devastation over just a few hours made this firestorm one of the worst in California history, with Gov. Jerry Brown  declaring a state of emergency . There have been injuries and people are unaccounted for, said Janet Upton, a spokeswoman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.  She could not estimate the number of injuries. Officials said additional fatalities were possible as search efforts continued. One of the raging fires had Santa Rosa under siege Monday morning, with a large swath of the city north of downtown under evacuation order. The fast-moving fire  jumped the 101 Freeway, forcing hospitals to be evacuated and, witnesses said, burning homes and businesses. The area of Fountaingrove appeared to be particularly hard hit, with photos showing numerous homes on fire. The Fountaingrove Inn and a Hilton hotel also burned. Officials said homes were also lost in the community of Kenwood and at a mobile home park off the 101 Freeway. While many evacuation centers were set up, some were filled to capacity due to the large number of people fleeing. \u2026 Schools throughout the Napa and Sonoma valleys are closed for the day, and cellphone service has been affected in Napa County, where residents and businesses are experiencing power outages and trees have been knocked down by the wind, officials said. More than 50 structures, including homes and barns, have burned in the Atlas Peak fire alone, Napa County Fire Chief Barry Biermann  said during the press conference. Residents described running from the approaching flames early in the morning. \u2026 Smoke from the fires drifted into the Bay Area, into San Francisco and as far south as San Jose. \u201cThe smell of smoke is everywhere throughout the county,\u201d Napa County spokeswoman Kristi Jourdan  said. In Santa Rosa, Kaiser Permanente Hospital and Sutter Hospital were evacuated. \u201cWe have safely evacuated the Santa Rosa medical center due to fires burning in the area. Many patients were transported to Kaiser Permanente in San Rafael and other local hospitals,\u201d Kaiser spokeswoman Jenny Mack said in an email. \u201cAll scheduled appointments and surgeries have been canceled for the day in Santa Rosa and the Napa medical offices.\u201d The Santa Rosa fire began around 10 p.m. The cause of the fires is still under investigation. Upward of 300 firefighters are battling the blazes in Napa County, she said. \u2026 \u201cWe\u2019ve had hospitals that have required evacuation\u2026all of those take significant amount of coordination and assets to ensure\u2026 that special needs populations and others that require special assistance are taken care of. That will remain our priority,\u201d said Mark Ghilarducci , director of the California Governor\u2019s Office of Emergency Services. There have been a number of injuries and \u201cpossibly some fatalities,\u201d Ghilarducci said. About 45,000 are without power and/or cell service in Napa and Sonoma counties, he said. \u2026 Weather conditions \u2014 strong winds and high temperatures \u2014 made conditions ripe for a major inferno. \u201cWe also had really gusty winds and really warm temperatures,\u201d said National Weather Service meteorologist Matt Mehle . \u201cThis time of year it does happen quite a bit. For the San Francisco Bay Area, our summer is late September to early October; that\u2019s when we have our warmest and driest conditions.\u201d The destructiveness of the fires shocked officials. The worst fire in recent California history was the Cedar blaze in San Diego County in 2003, which destroyed more than 2,800 homes. The 2007 Witch fire, also in San Diego County, destroyed more than 1,600. Both of those fires occurred in October. \u201cThis time of year is when historically the state\u2019s largest, most damaging and most deadly fires have occurred,\u201d Upton said. \u201cCritical fire conditions fanned by high wind\u201d act as \u201ca fuse for sparks,\u201d she said. A key reason why the fires burning through Napa and Sonoma counties became so devastating was that the ignitions happened at the worst possible moment: extremely dry conditions combined with so-called Diablo winds that fanned flames on the ridgetops with gusts as high as 70 mph. It\u2019s similar to the conditions that caused one of the most destructive fires in Northern California history, the October 1991 firestorm that struck the Oakland and Berkeley hills that killed 25 people and destroyed more than 3,300 single-family homes. The wine country fires so far haven\u2019t approached that level of catastrophe, with officials reporting at least 1,500 structures lost, in part because the area burned isn\u2019t as densely populated as the area that was hit hard in 1991. \u2026 Los Angeles Times staff writers Makeda Easter, Rong-Gong Lin II, Joy Resmovits amd Phil Willon contributed to this report.

Background The Tubbs fire near Santa Rosa has burned more than 35,000 acres as of 6:40 a.m., Napa County Supervisor Diane Dillon said during a televised press conference Monday morning. Officials said the other large fire in Napa County \u2014 Atlas Peak \u2014 has reached between 8,000 and 12,000 acres. Late Sunday night, Ken Moholt-Siebert  noticed the smell of the smoke from his Santa Rosa vineyard just off Highway 101. It was not until midnight that he spotted the flames: a small red glow growing a couple of ridges to the east, off Fountaingrove Parkway. He ran up the hill on his property to turn on a water pump to protect the ranch his family has been raising sheep and growing grapes on for four generations. Before the pump could get the water fully flowing, a small ember from the Tubbs fire landed nearby. With the wind picking up, the ember sparked a spot fire about 50 feet in diameter. Then it was 100 feet in diameter. \u201cThere was no wind, then there would be a rush of wind and it would stop. Then there would be another gust from a different direction,\u201d Moholt-Siebert, 51, said. \u201cThe flames wrapped around us.\u201d He ran for cover. \u201cI was just being pelted with all this smoke and embers,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just really fast.\u201d Moholt-Siebert retreated through a 150-year-old redwood barn on his property \u2014 where his son\u2019s wedding reception had been held in June. He jumped a fence back toward his house and fell to the ground to catch gulps of less smoke-contaminated air before reaching his home. As he fled with his wife Melissa in their Ford sedans, the flames reached their vineyard full of Pinot Noir grapes and crept toward a 200-year-old oak tree on the property \u2014 the namesake for the family winery, Ancient Oak Cellars. As he drove through falling embers and smoke he thought about what he left behind. The sheep on his ranch, he thought, would be safe since they were on shortly cut wet grass. He left behind family mementos and furniture from his grandparents. The property was dotted with old valley and black oak as well as some California ash trees. \u201cThat is probably all gone,\u201d Moholt-Siebert said. \u201cI have a feeling there is not going to be much left.\u201d Those who evacuated described a chaotic scene. Around 2 a.m., the Sonoma County Sheriff\u2019s Office ordered evacuations around Kay Drive and Mark West Station Road in Windsor. Jen Ancic , 31, fled with her two young sons and boyfriend. As the family drove north on U.S. Highway 101, Ancic said she could see buildings and trees burning. \u201cThe whole town was on fire,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was crazy.\u201d A Santa Rosa native, Ancic said that fires in the mountains are not uncommon, but \u201cnothing like has happened in Santa Rosa.\u201d \u2026 (from the Los Angeles Times article above) Resources Watch an October 9 CBS NY report: https://www.studentnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/North-Bay-California-wildfires_CBS-NY.mp4 Watch an October 9 KTVU local news report: https://www.studentnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/14-wildfires-race-through-Northern-CA_KTVU.mp4 Recent Daily News Articles Veterans Day 2017: Vets Plan To Boycott NFL Games On Sunday November 10, 2017 EPA approves bacteria-infected insects to kill mosquitoes November 9, 2017 Pa. officials still mostly mum on noncitizens registered to vote November 8, 2017 Tuesday\u2019s World News #1 \u2013 Lebanon November 7, 2017 US deserter Bowe Bergdahl spared prison time November 6, 2017 Get the App Follow Us Elsewhere About  \u00a0\u2014 Site Overview  \u00a0\u2014 Contact Us  \u00a0\u2014 Donate Launched in 2005, StudentNewsDaily.com is a 501(c)3 non-profit educational website.

The island landing was the first landfall of their expedition to find a westward route from Europe to China, Japan and perhaps unknown lands. American neoclassicist painter John Vanderlyn (1775-1852) was commissioned by Congress in June 1836 to paint the Landing of Columbus for the Capitol Rotunda. It was installed in the Rotunda by early January 1847. Jump to... Questions Background Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (from Dave Barton, Wallbuilders) \u2013\u00a0 Traditionally observed on the second Monday in October, Columbus Day commemorates the landing of Columbus in the \u201cNew World\u201d (on a small island off Florida) on October 12, 1492. Although Christopher Columbus clearly was not the first European to visit the \u201cNew World\u201d (Vikings had traveled here centuries earlier), he first widely publicized, and thus \u201cdiscovered,\u201d its existence to the Europeans. Columbus undertook his first voyage facing the prospect of great danger. The professional opinion of that day not only assured him of the impossibility of his proposed endeavor, but it also warned him that dragons and death awaited him beyond the charted waters. With such advice coming from the intellectual leaders of his day, his decision to embark on this unprecedented journey must have been difficult. So, then, why did he set out? Columbus himself answered that question in his own\u00a0writings: [O]ur Lord opened to my understanding (I could sense His hand upon me) so it became clear to me that it [the voyage] was feasible. . . . All those who heard about my enterprise rejected it with laughter, scoffing at me. . . . Who doubts that this illumination was from the Holy Spirit? I attest that He [the Holy Spirit], with marvelous rays of light, consoled me through the holy and sacred Scriptures . . . they inflame me with a sense of great urgency. . . . No one should be afraid to take on any enterprise in the name of our Savior if it is right and if the purpose is purely for His holy service. . . . And I say that the sign which convinces me that our Lord is hastening the end of the world is the preaching of the Gospel recently in so many lands. Americans celebrated Columbus\u2019s discovery of the New World and built numerous monuments to him in the late 19th century. The city of Columbus, Ohio was established in 1812. In addition, cities and towns, streets and health facilities, libraries, universities, schools, and in modern times sport teams bearing his name are symbols of his American stature. Columbus Day is a national holiday in the United States, proclaimed so in 1937 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The four voyages of Christopher Columbus (Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica) Christopher Columbus wrote a book entitled Book of Prophecies , in which he copied down Scripture [verses from the Bible] pertaining to bringing the gospel to unknown coast lands. The following is an excerpt from his Introduction to the book: At a very early age I began to sail upon the ocean. For more than forty years, I have sailed everywhere that people go. I prayed to the most merciful Lord about my heart\u2019s great desire, and He gave me the spirit and the intelligence for the task: seafaring, astronomy, geometry, arithmetic, skill in drafting spherical maps and placing correctly the cities, rivers, mountains and ports. I also studied cosmology, history, chronology and philosophy. It was the Lord who put into my mind (I could feel His hand upon me) the fact that it would be possible to sail from there to the Indies. All who heard of my project rejected it with laughter, ridiculing me. There is no question that the inspiration was from the Holy Spirit, because he comforted me with rays of marvelous illumination from the Holy Scriptures \u2026 encouraging me to continually to press forward and without ceasing for a moment they now encourage me make haste. Our Lord Jesus desired to perform a very obvious miracle in the voyage to the Indies, to comfort me and the whole people of God. I spent seven years in the royal court, discussing the matter with many persons of great reputation and wisdom in all the arts; and in the end they concluded that it was all foolishness, so they gave it up. \u2026 It is possible that those who see this book will accuse me of being unlearned in literature, of being a layman and a sailor. I reply with the words of Matt. 11:25, \u201cLord, because thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hath revealed them unto babes. \u2026 For the execution of the journey to the to the Indies I did not make use of intelligence, mathematics or maps. It is simply the fulfillment of what Isaiah had prophesied. All this is what I desire to write down for you in this book. No one should fear to undertake any task in the name of our Savior, if it is just and if the intention is purely for His holy service. The working out of all things has been assigned to each person by our Lord, but it all happens according to His sovereign will even though He gives advice. He lacks nothing that it is in the power of men to give him. Oh what a gracious Lord, who desires that people should perform for Him those things for which He holds Himself responsible! Day and night moment by moment, everyone should express to Him their most devoted gratitude. \u2026 Questions PLEASE NOTE:\u00a0 For Holiday postings\u00a0including Columbus Day\u00a0we do not provide an \u201cAnswers\u201d email, as the\u00a0questions typically vary by a student\u2019s own experience or are opinion questions. 1.\u00a0 a) What do you know from your American History textbooks about Christopher Columbus\u2019 motive for his voyages? b)\u00a0 How does that contrast with what Columbus himself wrote? 2.\u00a0 Which academic subjects did Columbus\u00a0study? 3.\u00a0 Which of the following words do you not associate with Christopher Columbus:\u00a0 adventurer, discoverer, explorer, Christian, sailor.\u00a0 Why is this so? 4.\u00a0 What most surprises you about the excerpt from Columbus\u2019 book?\u00a0 Why? 5.\u00a0 Columbus wrote a letter in 1493 to King Ferdinand\u2019s treasurer reporting on his voyage.

Questions Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by Barbara Starr, Ryan Browne and Brad Lendon, CNN) \u2013 Three US Green Berets were killed and two others were wounded in southwest Niger near the Mali-Niger border when a joint US-Nigeri e n patrol was attacked on Wednesday\u2026. A US official told CNN that initial indications are the Green Berets were ambushed by up to 50 fighters who are thought to be affiliated with ISIS. , which oversees military operations in Africa, issued a statement Thursday saying the two wounded US service members were \u201cevacuated in stable condition to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany.\u201d\u00a0The Command also confirmed Thursday that three US service members were killed in the attack and said the names were being withheld pending the notification of next of kin. US Africa Command Officials told CNN that French military Super Puma helicopters evacuated the wounded Americans along with those killed in action while also providing covering fire. The attack occurred approximately 125 miles north of the country\u2019s capital, Niamey, in southwest Niger, according to the statement from Africa Command. \u00a0\u2026 The Green Berets were part of a team advising and assisting local forces when they were attacked. \u2026 A spokeswoman for the confirmed that French troops from the French Ministry of Defense Barkhane anti-terror force  based in Chad are currently involved in an operation in Niger. She said the operation is being led by Niger and the French troops are there to support them. \u2026 There are about 800 US troops in Niger, and the US military has maintained a presence in the northwest African country for five years, with small groups of US Special Operations Forces advising local troops as they battle two terrorist groups, ISIS-affiliated Boko Haram and al Qaeda\u2019s North African branch, al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. \u201cNiger is an important partner of ours, we have a deep relationship with them,\u201d Lt. Gen. Kenneth McKenzie , the director of the Joint Staff, told reporters at the Pentagon Thursday. \u201cWe are committed to that relationship, we believe that they are as well. In fact, I think it\u2019s a very good success story,\u201d he added. U.S. forces were attacked near the Niger-Mali border. US officials view Chad, Niger and Mali as being particularity important as they serve as bridges between north and sub-Saharan Africa, saying that local al Qaeda and ISIS affiliates use their control of these transit routes to gain revenue that helps them recruit, expand and export attacks. ISIS uses these North-South transit routes to move fighters northward, where they can gain more easily access Europe and the West. One official told CNN that ISIS is attempting to infiltrate the gold mining industry in Niger to sell on the black market and finance world terrorism. Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb has maintained a presence in the Mali-Niger border area, despite a multi-year French-led military counterterrorism effort, Operation Barkhane , which began in 2014. The US military has largely played a supporting role, providing intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance assets in support of French forces operating in Mali and Niger. The French operation involves thousands of French troops as well as forces from Germany, Mali, Niger and other countries in the region. And while US troops largely play a supporting role, military leaders acknowledge the risks they face. \u201cClearly there\u2019s risks for our forces in Niger,\u201d Lt. Gen. McKenzie said while declining to discuss the specifics of Wednesday\u2019s attack, citing \u201congoing partnered operations.\u201d \u201cAny time we deploy full forces globally we look very hard at the enablers that need to be in place in order to provide security for them and that ranges from the ability to pull them out if they\u2019re injured to the ability to reinforce them at the point of a fight if they need reinforcement,\u201d he added. \u201cUS forces are in Niger to provide training and security assistance to the Nigerien Armed Forces, including support for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance efforts, in their efforts to target violent extremist organizations in the region,\u201d said US Navy Lt. Cmdr. Anthony Falvo , a spokesman for US Africa Command, adding, \u201cone aspect of that is training, advising and assisting the Nigeriens in order to increase their ability to bring stability and security to their people.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s attack comes after US drones struck ISIS fighters in neighboring Libya twice in a week in late September. Those two missions, the first under the Trump administration, suggest US officials have become increasingly concerned that the terror group is regaining strength in Libya. More than two dozen ISIS fighters were killed in the airstrikes, US Africa Command said. Wednesday\u2019s casualties were not the first this year in the US fight against terror groups in Africa. In May, was killed in Somalia during an operation against local al Qaeda affiliate al Shabaab. US Navy SEAL Kyle Milliken Milliken was the first US service member killed in action in Somalia since 1993, when two Black Hawk helicopters were shot down and 18 American soldiers were killed in the Battle for Mogadishu.

Questions Background Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by Anna Ringstrom, Ben Hirschler, Reuters) STOCKHOLM/LONDON \u2013 Three U.S. scientists won the 2017 Nobel prize for physics on Tuesday for opening up a new era of astronomy  by detecting gravitational waves , ripples in space and time foreseen by Albert Einstein a century ago. The work of Rainer Weiss, Barry Barish  and Kip Thorne  crowned half a century of experimental efforts by scientists and engineers. Measuring gravitational waves offers a new way to observe the cosmos , helping scientists explore the nature of mysterious objects including black holes and neutron stars. \u2026 \u201cWe now witness the dawn of a new field: ,\u201d Nils Martensson, acting chairman of the Nobel Committee for Physics, told reporters. gravitational wave astronomy \u201cThis will teach us about the most violent processes in the universe and it will lead to new insights into the nature of extreme gravity .\u201d Left to right: Rainer Weiss, Barry Barish and Kip Thorne, who have ben awarded the 2017 Nobel prize in physics. Weiss said the award of the 9 million Swedish crown ($1.1 million) prize was really a recognition of around 1,000 people working on wave detection. Two U.S.-based instruments working in unison, called the , detected the first waves caused by colliding black holes. A European sister facility, known as VIRGO based in Italy, has also detected waves more recently. [LIGO is the world\u2019s largest gravitational wave observatory and a cutting edge physics experiment. Comprised of two enormous laser interferometers located thousands of kilometers apart, LIGO exploits the physical properties of light and of space itself to detect and understand the origins of gravitational waves.\u00a0Visit the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) CalTech webpage  for info.] Those spotted so far have come from very distant black holes \u2013 extraordinarily dense objects whose existence was also predicted by Einstein \u2013 that smashed together to form a single, larger black hole. Weiss believes this is just the start. \u201cThere are a huge amount of things \u2026 in the universe that radiate gravitational waves. The black holes are the most obvious but there are many, many others,\u201d he said in a telephone call with the Nobel committee. Other experts share that excitement and said LIGO and VIRGO offered new ways to explore the fundamental nature of the universe that have so far been impossible, even with the most sophisticated telescopes. Because gravitational waves are radically different from electromagnetic waves  such as radio waves, visible light, infrared light and X-rays, they are expected to reveal previously inaccessible features. \u2026 The signals from gravitational waves are extremely weak when they reach Earth and therefore require exquisitely accurate measurement. \u201cThese represent some of the most precise measurements that are made by physicists,\u201d Nobel committee member David Haviland told Reuters. Designed to pick up tiny vibrations as they pass through the Earth, the laser detectors spot changes thousands of times smaller than an atomic nucleus. The scientists then convert the wave signal into sound waves and can listen to the \u201cchirps\u201d of the black holes merging. LIGO Hanford (Richland, Washington). Fitting a LIGO interferometer in one frame is extremely difficult because of the size of the instrument. In this photo, all of LIGO Hanford\u2019s [left]-arm is seen stretching off into the desert, but less than half of the [right]-arm fits into the photo. The mid- and end-stations are labeled, but the arm is so long (2.5 miles) that the perspective of the shot distorts the distance between them. (Credit: Caltech/MIT/LIGO Lab) Physics is the second \u2026Nobel Prize [to be awarded this year] and comes after\u2026the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine [which was announced] on Monday. The prizes for achievements in science, literature and peace were first awarded in 1901 in accordance with the will of Swedish business tycoon Alfred Nobel, who bequeathed much of the fortune he generated from his discovery of dynamite. Among the science prizes, physics has often taken center stage with laureates including superstars such as Einstein, Niels Bohr and Marie Curie, one of only two women to win a Nobel prize in physics. Weiss won half of this year\u2019s prize, with Barish and Thorne sharing the other half.  [\u201cMy feelings at the time were a complicated mixture of being thrilled and being humbled,\u201d Barish said at a Caltech news conference on Tuesday. The waves were predicted by Albert Einstein in 1916 as part of his , which argues that gravity is caused by heavy objects bending space-time, which itself is the four-dimensional way that astronomers see the universe. theory of general relativity The prize is\u00a0\u201ca win for Einstein, and a very big one,\u201d\u00a0Barish told the AP.] Additional reporting by Niklas Pollard, Simon Johnson, Helena Soderpalm, Daniel Dickson and Johannes Hellstrom; editing by John Stonestreet From Reuters .com.

Background THE NOBEL PRIZE Every year since 1901 the Nobel Prize has been awarded for achievements in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature and for peace. The Nobel Prize is an international award administered by the Nobel Foundation in Stockholm, Sweden. In 1968, Sveriges Riksbank established The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, founder of the Nobel Prize. Each prize consists of a medal, personal diploma, and a cash award. The prizes are always handed out in ceremonies on Dec. 10, the date that prize founder Alfred Nobel died in 1896. About LIGO, from an Oct. 3rd Washington Post report by Ben Guarino: Albert Einstein predicted in his 1915 general theory of relativity that distortions in gravity would travel through space-time like a shock wave. It took nearly a century to confirm that these distortions exist, a feat that required huge contraptions in two locations to detect an ultra-tiny ripple in the fabric of space. One half of the prize went to Weiss, born in Berlin and now a U.S. citizen, who is a physics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The other half was split by Barish, a Nebraska native, and Thorne, who was born in Utah. Both work at the California Institute of Technology. \u201cWhen we first discovered them back in September 2015, many of us didn\u2019t believe it,\u201d Weiss said. It took months for the scientists to convince themselves that the (LIGO) detectors found gravitational waves, he said. Detectors sensed three other gravitational waves since the first, all from merging black holes. The LIGO team, plus the Italian Virgo detector,\u00a0announced\u00a0the most recent cosmic distortion discovery in September. A team of more than 1,000 scientists, researchers and technicians make up the\u00a0LIGO Scientific Collaboration. Yet three people at most can share a Nobel Prize, a rule that\u00a0critics say is too restrictive. Scientists proposed using lasers to measure gravitational waves in the 1960s. Weiss conceived of the first L-shaped laser interferometers while teaching a course on general relativity at MIT decades ago. The device consists of twin laser beams shot down an interferometer\u2019s branching arms, both of equal length. At the end of each arm is a mirror. The lasers bounce off the mirror to return at precisely the same time. If something has jiggled the fabric of space \u2014 like the long-ago collision of a black hole \u2014 one arm elongates or contracts out of sync with the other. These distortions are so small as to be inconceivable: a wobble a thousandth the width of an atom\u2019s nucleus. The lasers\u2019 mismatched return, however slight, signifies that space has warped. Meanwhile, Thorne helped advance the theory of gravitational waves. He described how the waves, which could be the product of merging black holes or colliding neutron stars, stretch space and time. \u201cLIGO would not exist without Kip [Thorne]\u2019s vision for the scientific potential of gravitational waves and his amazing gift for sharing that vision with other scientists,\u201d said Caltech\u2019s Stan Whitcomb, a LIGO Laboratory scientist, in a statement. U.S. military grants to develop small interferometers gave way to an ambitious proposal. In 1984, MIT and Caltech agreed to design and construct LIGO, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, together. \u2026 \u201cI always wanted to be an experimental physicist and was attracted to the idea of using continuing advances in technology to carry out fundamental science experiments that could not be done otherwise,\u201d Barish said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cLIGO is a prime example of what couldn\u2019t be done before.\u201d \u201cBarish, in my opinion, is the most brilliant leader of large science projects that physics has ever seen,\u201d Thorne said. LIGO is funded by the National Science Foundation. All told, the detectors had a $1.1 billion price tag. Resources Visit the website to read about the .

Jump to... Questions Background Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by Niklas Pollard and Ben Hirschler, Reuters) STOCKHOLM/LONDON \u2013 U.S. scientists Jeffrey Hall, Michael Rosbash  and Michael Young  won the 2017 Nobel prize for medicine on Monday for unraveling molecular  mechanisms that control our internal body clocks. These help explain how people experience jet lag when their internal get out of sync, while also having wider implications for disorders ranging from insomnia to depression to heart disease. circadian rhythms , or the study of biological clocks, is now a growing field of research thanks to the pioneering work of the three scientists, who explained the role of specific genes in keeping fruit flies in step with light and darkness. Chronobiology Today, scientists are exploring new treatments based on such circadian cycles, including establishing the best times to take medicines, and there is an increased focus on the importance of healthy sleeping patterns. \u201cThis ability to prepare for the regular daily fluctuations is crucial for all life forms,\u201d Thomas Perlmann, secretary of the Nobel Committee, told reporters. \u201cThis year\u2019s Nobel prize laureates have been studying this fundamental problem and solved the mystery of how an inner clock in our bodies can anticipate daily fluctuations between night and day to optimize our behavior and physiology.\u201d Rosbash  said the news that the trio had won the Nobel prize, which is worth 9 million Swedish crowns ($1.1 million), was \u201ca little overwhelming.\u201d \u201cIt took my breath away, literally. I was woken up out of deep sleep and it was shocking,\u201d he told Reuters. \u201cIt\u2019s great for basic science. It hasn\u2019t had a tremendous amount of practical impact yet, so it\u2019s really a very basic discovery \u2026 It\u2019s good to have the attention on this kind of basic work.\u201d Hall, most recently of the University of Maine, collaborated with Rosbash while they both were at Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts. They split the prize with Young of Rockefeller University in New York City. Scientists were already pondering the concept of body clock genes in the 1960s and 1970s. Then, in the mid-1980s, the three laureates used fruit flies to isolate a gene called period that controls the normal daily biological rhythm and showed how it encodes a protein called PER that accumulates in cells during the night and degrades during the day. Further research revealed the role of other genes in the complex system. \u201cWe were hopeful what we did [with flies] would pertain more widely,\u201d Young said in news briefing at Rockefeller University on Monday, but added that \u201cit has unfolded in a way that just couldn\u2019t be imagined at the beginning.\u201d Young said the trio could not have anticipated that the whole system could be revealed in their lifetimes, but new scientific tools helped accelerate the work. \u201cJust like puzzle pieces, the genes fell out and the way they work together provided this beautiful mechanism that we now appreciate.\u201d Their discoveries help explain how plants, animals and humans adapt their biological rhythm  to be in synch with the Earth\u2019s revolutions. \u2026 Scientists now understand that body clocks influence alertness, hunger, metabolism, fertility, mood and other physiological  conditions. And researchers have begun to study the implications of erratic  sleeping and working patterns [on] children who stay up late. \u201cWe are learning more and more what impact it has to not follow your clock,\u201d Nobel committee member Christer Hoog told Reuters. \u201cIf you constantly disobey your clock, what will happen? Medical research is going on with regards to that.\u201d Even plants have body clocks. Plants open during the day and close at night, but Jean Jacques d\u2019Ortous de Mairan found that even plants kept in constant darkness continue to follow a similar rhythm. Medicine is the first of the Nobel Prizes awarded each year. The prizes for achievements in science, literature and peace were created in accordance with the will of dynamite inventor and businessman Alfred Nobel and have been awarded since 1901. Nobel medicine laureates have included scientific greats such as Alexander Fleming, the discoverer of penicillin, and Karl Landsteiner, whose identification of separate blood types opened the way to carrying out safe transfusions.

Chronobiologists, who study this kind of science, emphasize the importance of the discovery because it\u2019s only after accepting body clocks as a biological fact that you can fully appreciate how big a role they play in our health. \u2026 As biological creatures, we can\u2019t all be at peak energy throughout the day. Sometimes we need to be on high alert and able to react quickly. At other times, we need to eat, rest, and sleep to regain energy. Our body clock regulates these phases, which is why most of us sleep at night and are awake during the day \u2014 though there\u2019s significant variation among people as to when we feel most awake and most asleep, regulated by genetics and other factors. Understanding there is a physical cycle and biological factors that all work together helps explain why it\u2019s hard to suddenly pull all-nighters, adjust to a new time zone, or start waking up earlier: Your entire body, down to your cells, needs time to adapt.

Questions Background Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by Andrew Chung, Reuters) WASHINGTON \u2013 U.S. Supreme Court justices on Monday expressed skepticism toward part of an immigration law requiring the deportation of immigrants who commit violent felonies because of uncertainty over which crimes fit the bill and which do not. The justices heard arguments in the government\u2019s appeal of a lower court\u2019s ruling that language in the calling for deportation of legal immigrants convicted of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d was so vague that it violated their rights to due process of law under the U.S. Constitution. Immigration and Nationality Act The case involves a Filipino legal immigrant named James Garcia Dimaya  who federal authorities ordered deported after he was convicted in two California home burglaries, though neither crime involved violence. \u2026The ruling in the case could help clarify the crimes for which non-citizen immigrants may be expelled, affecting the Trump administration\u2019s policy of stepping up the removal those with criminal records. \u2026 Monday\u2019s arguments marked the second time the court has tried to tackle the case. It heard arguments in January when the nine-seat court was one justice short [following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia], then decided in June to have the case re-argued this term after Conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch [was confirmed]. \u2026.. Dimaya came to the United States from the Philippines as a legal permanent resident in 1992 at age 13. He lived with his family in the San Francisco Bay area, and had worked in several retail store jobs, including as a manager. He was convicted in residential burglaries in 2007 and 2009 in crimes in which no violence was used and no one was injured. For each conviction he was sentenced to two years in prison. In 2010, the Obama administration began a process to deport Dimaya. The Justice Department\u2019s Board of Immigration Appeals, the highest U.S. administrative body for interpreting and applying immigration laws, refused to cancel his expulsion because the law involved defines burglary as a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d In the federal criminal code , a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d includes offenses in which force either was used or carried a \u201csubstantial risk\u201d that it would be used. The San Francisco-based liberal 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  ruled in 2015 that the definition as applied to non-citizen immigrants was unconstitutionally vague and can lead to arbitrary enforcement of the law.\u00a0The appeals court relied on a decision that same year by the U.S. Supreme Court in a different case, which found that a similar provision in a federal criminal sentencing law was overly broad. The 7th Circuit Court in Chicago handed down a similar ruling to the 9th Circuit, while the 5th Circuit in New Orleans ruled in favor of the government. The split prompted the high court to decide the case of Lynch vs. Dimaya . By the time\u00a0the decision is handed down, the case will probably be relabeled Sessions vs. Dimaya , to reflect expected change of attorney general. [President Obama\u2019s Attorney General was Loretta Lynch; President Trump\u2019s Attorney General is Jeff Sessions.] The case was argued on Monday, the first day of the court\u2019s new term. A ruling is due by the end of June. From Reuters .com. Reprinted here for educational purposes only. May not be reproduced on other websites without permission from Thomson Reuters.

Background On the Supreme Court from BensGuide.gpo.gov : Approximately 7,500 cases are sent to the Supreme Court each year. Out of these, only 80 to 100 are actually heard by the Supreme Court. When a case comes to the Supreme Court, several things happen. First, the Justices get together to decide if a case is worthy of being brought before the Court. In other words, does the case really involve Constitutional or federal law ? Secondly, a Supreme Court ruling can affect the outcome of hundreds or even thousands of cases in lower courts around the country. Therefore, the Court tries to use this enormous power only when a case presents a pressing constitutional issue. \u2026 The Supreme Court convenes, or meets, the first Monday in October. It stays in session usually until late June of the next year. When they are not hearing cases, the Justices do legal research and write opinions. On Fridays, they meet in private (in \u201cconference\u201d) to discuss cases they\u2019ve heard and to vote on them. \u2026 Most cases do not start in the Supreme Court. Usually cases are first brought in front of lower (state or federal) courts. Each disputing party is made up of a petitioner and a respondent. Once the lower court makes a decisions, if the losing party does not think that justice was served, s/he may appeal the case, or bring it to a higher court. In the state court system, these higher courts are called appellate courts. In the federal court system, the lower courts are called United States District Courts and the higher courts are called United States Courts of Appeals. If the higher court\u2019s ruling disagrees with the lower court\u2019s ruling, the original decision is overturned. If the higher court\u2019s ruling agrees with the lower court\u2019s decision, then the losing party may ask that the case be taken to the Supreme Court.\u00a0But \u2026 only cases involving federal or Constitutional law are brought to the highest court in the land. EXPLANATION OF PROCEDURE FOR ORAL ARGUMENTS IN THE SUPREME COURT: (from supremecourt.gov/visiting/visitorsguidetooralargument.aspx ) A case selected for argument \u00a0usually involves interpretations of the U. S. Constitution or federal law. At least four Justices have selected the case as being of such importance that the Supreme Court must resolve the legal issues. An attorney for each side of a case will have an opportunity to make a presentation to the Court and answer questions posed by the Justices. Prior to the argument each side has submitted a legal brief \u00a0\u2013 a written legal argument outlining each party\u2019s points of law. The Justices have read these briefs prior to argument and are thoroughly familiar with the case, its facts, and the legal positions that each party is advocating. Beginning the first Monday in October, the Court generally hears two one-hour arguments a day, at 10 a.m. and 11 a.m., with occasional afternoon sessions scheduled as necessary. Arguments are held on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays in two-week intervals through late April (with longer breaks during December and February). The argument calendars are posted on the Court\u2019s Website under the \u201cOral Arguments\u201d \u00a0link. In the recesses between argument sessions, the Justices are busy writing opinions, deciding which cases to hear in the future, and reading the briefs for the next argument session. They grant review in approximately 100 of the more than 10,000 petitions filed with the Court each term. No one knows exactly when a decision will be handed down by the Court in an argued case, nor is there a set time period in which the Justices must reach a decision. However, all cases argued during a term of Court are decided before the summer recess begins, usually by the end of June . During an argument week, the Justices meet in a private conference, closed even to staff, to discuss the cases and to take a preliminary vote on each case. If the Chief Justice is in the majority on a case decision, he decides who will write the opinion . He may decide to write it himself or he may assign that duty to any other Justice in the majority. If the Chief Justice is in the minority, the Justice in the majority who has the most seniority assumes the assignment duty. On the Role of Judges: Judges are like umpires in baseball or referees in football or basketball. Their role is to see that the rules of court procedures are followed by both sides. Like the ump, they call \u2018em as they see \u2018em, according to the facts and law-without regard to which side is popular (no home field advantage), without regard to who is \u201cfavored,\u201d without regard for what the spectators want, and without regard to whether the judge agrees with the law. (from the American Bar Asociation) \u201cThe role of a judge is to be a neutral interpreter of already established law, not legislator of new law or social policy.\u00a0 A judge can have his or her own opinions, even strong ones, and still read the law neutrally.\u00a0 Fundamentally, judges are expected to not bring their personal politics and philosophies to the bench. Judges are expected to read the law in its clear intent and apply it without regard to result. Changing the law should be left to the people and their legislators.\u201d Sean Rushton, Committee for Justice Executive Director,\u00a0from\u00a0the WashingtonPost.com . \u201cOne of the big confusions in the\u2026Senate fight over the confirmation of judicial nominees is that this is an issue about \u2018liberal\u2019 judges versus \u2018conservative\u2019 judges.\u00a0 The vastly more important issue is whether people who go into court should expect their cases to be decided on the basis of the law or on the basis of the particular judge\u2019s own philosophy\u2026Liberals have rooted for judicial activism because this activism has favored liberal causes and liberal views on such issues as abortion, the death penalty, gay marriage, and racial quotas.\u00a0 But activism can be used by any judge for any purpose.\u201d Thomas Sowell, Hoover Institution NOTE: \u00a0\u2026It is crucial\u2026to have a president who understands the judiciary\u2019s proper role. As Ronald Reagan once noted, \u201c[The Founders] knew that the courts, like the Constitution itself, must not be liberal or conservative.\u201d For Reagan and for the Founders, judges were to be selected based on their ability to put political preferences aside and interpret the Constitution and laws based on their original meaning.\u00a0 Rather than scrutinizing judicial nominees based on their perceived political leanings, [every] president should appoint judges who apply the law regardless of their own policy preferences.

Questions Background Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by Mark Moore, New York Post) \u2013 China upped the pressure to isolate North Korea on Thursday by ordering [North Korean companies operating in its territory to close down as it implements United Nations against]\u00a0Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear and missile programs, according to reports. sanctions China, Pyongyang\u2019s only major ally, has already banned trade and limited oil exports following previous sanctions. The goal of the sanctions is for the complete, verifiable and irreversible textile of North Korea (the Korean Peninsula). denuclearization China, the main trading partner with North Korea, said the businesses must close within 120 days of the UN Security Council\u2019s Sept. 11 vote to impose strict trade penalties against President Kim Jong Un\u2019s government for detonating a nuclear device earlier this month, China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce said. China accounts for more than 80% of North Korea\u2019s trade. The move is part of an international response \u2013\u00a0orchestrated by the Trump administration \u2013 to North Korea\u2019s sixth and most powerful nuclear test. The UN Security Council, of which China is a member, voted unanimously for new sanctions  (written by the U.S.) on September 11. The [closures will] severely crimp Kim Jong Un\u2019s ability to generate revenue to fund his weapons program because many North Korean companies run restaurants in China and a large part of the country\u2019s laborers work in Chinese factories and other businesses and send money back home. Despite the sanctions, the Chinese ministry still encouraged the US to engage North Korea in a dialogue to defuse the escalating conflict between the two countries. \u201cThe Korean Peninsula nuclear issue is related to regional peace and stability,\u201d ministry spokesman Lu Kang said. \u201cBreaking the deadlock requires all relevant parties to show their sincerity.\u201d President Trump, during a speech to the United Nations General Assembly last week, said \u201cRocket Man\u201d Kim was on a \u201csuicide mission for himself\u201d and warned the US would \u201ctotally destroy North Korea\u201d if forced to defend itself or its allies. Beijing has been under public pressure from President Donald Trump to take action against North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program. Along with the nuclear device, North Korea has been test-firing with enough range to strike the US mainland. intercontinental ballistic missiles The latest UN sanctions against the regime put tight restrictions on the government\u2019s importing of oil, natural gas and textiles. President Trump also signed an executive order last week that gave the Treasury Department \u201cenhanced\u201d authority to target financial institutions [banks] that do business with North Korea. \u201cNorth Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons and missile development is a grave threat to peace and security in our world. And it is unacceptable that others financially support this criminal, rogue regime,\u201d Trump said after signing the order last Thursday. Reprinted here for educational purposes only.

Last Monday, China ordered its banks to stop doing business with North Korea. What new move has China made after agreeing to the U.S.-written UN sanctions against North Korea? 3. What is the ultimate goal of the sanctions against North Korea? 4. What action taken by North Korea caused the U.S., China, and the rest of the UN Security Council to agree unanimously to the sanctions? (What action had North Korea taken?) 5. North Korea has been working on its nuclear weapons program through several administrations \u2013 eight years each of Presidents Clinton, Bush and Obama. Negotiations, financial incentives, and lesser sanctions have failed for years. They have not had an effect on stopping North Korea\u2019s pursuit of these weapons. North Korea now has been test-firing intercontinental ballistic missiles with enough range to strike the US mainland. President Trump has taken a different and much stronger approach to dealing with North Korea than any of his predecessors. Ask a parent: Do you think the president has the right strategy of trying to completely cut off North Korea from any outside trade, persuading China to go along with the plan, working within the UN Security Council \u2013 all while talking tough about Kim Jong Un?

Background From a Sept. 12 CNN report: On Monday, September 11, the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted a US-drafted resolution to impose new sanctions on North Korea \u00a0\u2014 a move that came just one week after the rogue nation carried out its sixth and largest nuclear test. The resolution is designed to accomplish six major goals, according to a US official familiar with negotiations: cap North Korea\u2019s oil imports ban textile exports end additional overseas laborer contracts suppress smuggling efforts stop joint ventures with other nations and sanction designated North Korean government entities Following the vote Monday US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley said: \u201cToday, we are saying the world will never accept a nuclear armed North Korea, and today the Security Council is saying that if the North Korean regime does not halt its nuclear program, we will act to stop it ourselves,\u201d \u201cWe are done trying to prod the regime to do the right thing, we are now trying to stop it from having the ability to do the wrong thing,\u201d she added. From a June 27 Business Insider report: \u00a0Chinese state media reported that China and the U.S. agreed that efforts to the Korean Peninsula should be \u201ccomplete, verifiable and irreversible,\u201d after high level talks in Washington. denuclearize During his meeting with top Chinese diplomats and defense chiefs, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had said that the U.S. pressed China to ramp up economic and political pressure on North Korea. China\u2019s top diplomat Yang Jiechi and General Fang Fenghui met Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis during the talks. Yang later met with U.S. President Donald Trump in the White House, where they also discussed North Korea, Xinhua reported. Chinese state media described the talks, the first of their kind with the Trump administration, as an upgrade in dialogue mechanisms between China and the U.S., following \u00a0President Xi Jiping\u2019s meeting with President Trump in Florida in April.

Ricardo Rossello Jump to... Questions Background Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by Robin Respaut and Dave Graham, Reuters) SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico \u2013 U.S. President Donald Trump temporarily lifted restrictions on foreign shipping from the U.S. mainland to Puerto Rico on Thursday to help get supplies quickly to the U.S. territory as it reels from the devastation of Hurricane Maria. But even so, the island still faces huge hurdles to distribute badly needed food, fuel and drinking water. Most of the Caribbean island\u2019s 3.4 million people also are without electricity. logistical Brock Long, the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) , said he was dissatisfied with the federal response but that relief operations had been hampered by damage to the air traffic control system, airports and ports [and roads]. Shipping containers have been piling up at Puerto Rico\u2019s ports in the aftermath of Maria, which struck on Sept. 20, causing widespread flooding and major damage to homes, roads and other . infrastructure Responding to Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello\u2019s  request, President Trump on Thursday the waived Jones Act , which only allows U.S. owned-and-operated vessels to ship between U.S. ports.\u00a0The waiver is meant\u00a0to ensure there is no impediment to bringing in supplies, will be in force for 10 days and will cover all products shipped to Puerto Rico \u00a0\u2026 The U.S. government has periodically lifted the Jones Act for a temporary period following violent storms, including after hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which hit Texas and Florida in late August and earlier this month. \u00a0\u2026.. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders  announced on Twitter that Trump had authorized the Jones Act waiver at Gov. Rossello\u2019s request. The governor, who has staunchly defended Trump\u2019s response to the hurricane, retweeted [Sanders\u2019] post with a \u201cThank you @POTUS\u201d \u2013 referring to the Republican president\u2019s official Twitter handle. \u2026 Even if the waiver helps speed cargo to the island, Puerto Rico is still struggling to move supplies around. \u201cReally our biggest challenge has been the assets to try to get some of the food and some of the water to different areas of Puerto Rico,\u201d Rossello said interview with MSNBC on Thursday. logistical \u201cWe need truck drivers,\u201d he said, adding he had asked the Department of Defense to send troops to help with transportation. \u201cThe food is here, the water is here. We welcome more help. But critically, what we need is equipment,\u201d and people, either national or state troops, Rossello said. FEMA\u2019s Long told CNN that relief operations had been hindered by damage to the transport , adding, \u201dThe situation is not allowing things to move as quickly as we would all like. infrastructure \u201cNo, I\u2019m not satisfied because the fact is, is that we will not be satisfied until we stabilize the situation, which is why we work day in and day out, hour after hour, to try to alleviate the situation,\u201d he said. U.S. Military personnel are playing a sizable role. The military had delivered fuel to nine hospitals and helped establish more than 100 distribution centers for food and water on the island, the Pentagon said on Thursday. It also was shipping a large generator to power a radar center to help air traffic control in San Juan and other airports. Five of six priority sea ports were open, although some had restrictions on the size of the vessel or were for daylight use only, the Pentagon said. A barge with 100 defense trucks carrying diesel and gasoline was expected to arrive in San Juan by Monday. In Washington, the Transportation Department on Thursday made $40 million in \u201cquick release\u201d Emergency Relief funds to help restore essential service on roads and bridges damaged by Maria throughout Puerto Rico. The money was in addition to $2.5 million in emergency funds awarded to Puerto Rico after Irma, according to the department\u2019s Federal Highway Administration. (end Reuters) Crowley Maritime,  a Jacksonville, Fla.-based ship operator that serves the island , said in a statement that it had \u201cmore than 3,000 loads of food, supplies and other cargo\u201d in San Juan awaiting distribution but that efforts to restore transportation were resuming only slowly. \u201cWe want to get goods to people as quickly and efficiently as possible,\u201d Jose Ayala, Crowley\u2019s vice president of Puerto Rico services , said in a statement. He said the company was still trying to get truckers to take goods and bring back shipping containers to carry more supplies. The company said it had brought in five new barges to join its existing ships to bring in supplies, which are coming mostly from Jacksonville. Other companies are moving goods through the airport in San Juan. U.S. Coast Guard Vice Admiral Karl Schultz  said that the ports \u201clook fairly good\u201d but that computer systems weren\u2019t working and that other infrastructure, including buoys used to help ships navigate were still being restored. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to work and find out are the facilities ready: Even if the ships are ready to come in are they ready to offload petroleum? Are they ready to offload containers and things like that?\u201d he said in an interview\u00a0Monday\u00a0before a flight to the island to assess the ports. \u201cThe story is trending in a good direction, but because of the communications challenges that\u2019s a little of the uphill here.\u201d Crowley and TOTE Maritime, another shipping company serving the island, each said they had unloaded nearly 3,000 40-foot containers with relief goods since the port reopened. Mr. Ayala said in a telephone interview that most of the containers holding medicine, food, raw materials and other relief supplies have not moved, however. \u201cThat part of logistics from our terminal, that supply chain has been interrupted,\u201d he said. \u201cThe biggest challenge is how you can move the cargo. The cargo is here. The people of Puerto Rico should not have any fear that there is not going to be food or medicine on the island. But, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s pretty ugly out there\u2026. There is damage to the trucking infrastructure, to the distributors, to the supermarkets, to the roads. And then, if your infrastructure is not so damaged, and you can get a driver to the truck, there is no fuel to move the equipment.\u201d Mr. Ayala said roads in the immediate area around San Juan are severely damaged and that sites further from the capital appear to be impassable. \u201cWe have been talking to truck drivers and they say if it is challenging around San Juan now, imagine driving a truck with 40-foot container attached, it\u2019s impossible,\u201d he said.

Background Where is the National Guard? \u201cNational Guard head: Puerto Rico clean-up will \u2018challenge the system'\u201d (from thehill .com, by Ellen Mitchell, Sept. 25, 2017) \u2013\u00a0 The clean-up efforts for U.S. territories following Hurricane Maria are expected to be far more complicated and lengthy than those for Florida and Texas in the wake of Hurricane Harvey, according to the head of the National Guard Bureau. said\u00a0Monday\u00a0that it will be \u201ca harder response scenario\u201d to restore power and necessary infrastructure, likely taking months. Gen. Joseph Lengyel \u201cPuerto Rico and the Virgin Islands are not Texas and Florida. They\u2019re out here in the middle of the ocean. It\u2019s more complicated to get people here, it\u2019s more complicated to fix the power grids, it\u2019s more complicated to fix a whole lot of other things,\u201d Lengyel told The Hill while traveling to St. Croix to meet with government officials and assess the damage. \u201cThis response in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands is going to challenge the system.\u201d \u2026Virgin Islands Gov. Kenneth Mapp (R) described the six days following Maria as \u201chorrendous,\u201d with 80 percent of the islands\u2019 power distribution systems destroyed.\u00a0\u201cTwo [Category] 5 hurricanes come through, 12 days apart,\u201d Mapp told reporters in St. Croix. \u201cWe need a lot of support in terms of how we\u2019re going to coordinate getting food here. We\u2019re really rushed wrapping up on a plan on how we\u2019re going to rebuild resiliently \u00a0\u2013 as opposed to rebuild fast, \u201d he said. The islands are now 90 to 100 percent without power , and Lengyel expects it will be \u201cmore than a month\u201d until electricity is fully restored. For now, the primary Guard mission is search and rescue, food and water distribution, and standing up operations and communications. Hurricane Irma\u00a0earlier this month hit Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands as a Category 5 storm, followed by Florida and Georgia, causing more than 55 deaths. Maria followed through the Caribbean less than\u00a0two weeks later, also a Category 5 storm, further trashing the already ravaged U.S. territories. Clean-up efforts on the islands are hindered by the presence of significantly fewer forces than in the continental United States, with additional troops who must be flown in instead of driven, Lengyel said. [Note:] Puerto Rico has only 1,375 Guard troops to help on an island with a population of nearly 3.5 million. The Virgin Islands, meanwhile, have roughly 1,200 troops \u2014\u00a0800 from out of state \u2014\u00a0across St. Croix, St. Thomas and St. John. Texas, in comparison, had a high of 20,000 National Guard forces, including 12,000 from Texas alone, to aid after Hurricane Harvey. Lengyel met with FEMA Administrator Brock Long, White House Homeland Security adviser Tom Bossert, Virgin Islands Gov. Mapp and Virgin Islands National Guard Adjutant Gen. Brig. Gen. Deborah Howell. After the meeting, Lengyel told reporters Gov. Mapp was happy with the support he was receiving from the federal government and was asking for more security forces to combat looting following Maria.\u00a0Another 1,000 to 1,500 troops are expected to be in the Virgin Islands in the coming days. \u201cThey\u2019re requesting everything they need and all the [documents] have been signed. I expect that they\u2019re flying those forces in here over the next week,\u201d he said.

Questions Background Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by Jack Crowe, The Daily Caller) \u2013 President Donald Trump [introduced] Republicans\u2019 newly-released tax reform framework as a much needed economic boon to the struggling middle class during a Wednesday speech. Trump touted the established by the \u201cAmerican model,\u201d tax reform  framework released Wednesday, arguing that the cuts to individual, small business and corporate tax rates  will spur economic growth, thereby increasing wages and employment for middle class Americans. \u201cMy fellow Americans, this is the right tax cut and this is the right time. Democrats and Republicans in Congress should come together finally to deliver this giant win for the American people and begin a middle class miracle,\u201d Trump said. During the address, the president stressed the importance of reducing the corporate tax rate from the existing 35 percent down to 20 percent, a point on which he has vowed not to negotiate. He spent much of the speech explaining how [such a significant] corporate tax cut will translate into employment and wage gains for the American worker. \u201cWe will reduce the corporate tax rate to no higher than 20 percent,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis is a revolutionary change and the biggest winners will be the everyday American worker, as jobs start pouring into our country, as companies start competing for American labor, and as wages start going up to levels that you haven\u2019t seen in many years.\u201d Trump also emphasized tax code simplification , which the plan accomplishes [by reducing] the existing seven tax brackets down to three individual income brackets, taxed at 12, 25 and 35 percent respectively. In addition to simplification and rate cuts, Trump cited the elimination of most itemized deductions as evidence of his\u2026prioritization of the interests of the middle class over those of the wealthy. \u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can to reduce the tax burden on you and your family,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBy eliminating tax breaks and loopholes we will ensure the benefits are focused on the middle class, the working men and women not the highest earners.\u201d The framework leaves open the possibility of an additional fourth tax bracket carrying an increased rate for the highest earners, a fact Trump pointed to as further evidence of his commitment to the middle class. [Also included is a repeal of the \u201cdeath tax\u201d (estate tax) as well as a repeal of the \u201calternative minimum tax.\u201d] \u201cOur framework includes our explicit commitment that tax reform will protect low income and middle income households not the wealthy,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can call me all they want but its not going to help.\u201d Reprinted here for educational purposes only.

Questions Background Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by Nolan D. McCaskill, Politico) \u2013 Four NCAA Division I coaches have been arrested and charged in a major college basketball fraud and corruption scheme, the Justice Department announced Tuesday, days before college basketball season officially commences for coaches and players. Joon Kim, acting U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York , revealed an ongoing years-long probe that had been covert until it was announced Tuesday\u2026 \u201cToday, we announce charges for fraud and corruption in the world of college basketball,\u201d Kim said. Chuck Person , Auburn\u2019s associate head coach; Tony Bland , USC\u2019s associate head coach; Lamont Evans , Oklahoma State\u2019s associate head coach and recruiting coordinator; and Emanuel Richardson , Arizona\u2019s assistant coach, are among 10 people facing federal criminal charges. A combination photo shows NCAA coaches L-R, Lamont Evans, Emanuel Richardson, Tony Bland and Chuck Person in these USA Today Sports file photos. REUTERS The FBI and U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office  have been investigating since 2015 the criminal influence of money  on coaches and NCAA student-athletes, a probe that began with a cooperative witness and included two undercover FBI agents and wiretaps. The FBI detailed its allegations in three separate complaints spanning more than 100 pages. At a news conference announcing the charges Tuesday afternoon, Kim cast the coaches as corrupt individuals who sold out their players to enrich themselves. The documents allege that the coaches took bribes in exchange for influencing their players to sign with financial managers and advisers once they entered the NBA. \u2026 Those charged include three people associated with professional managers and advisers [college players are not permitted to have agents] and three others with ties to , the global sportswear company. \u201cFor these men, bribing coaches was a business investment,\u201d Kim said. \u201cThey knew that the corrupt coaches in return for bribes would pressure the players to use their services. And they also knew that if and when those young players turned pro, that would mean big bucks for them in professional fees and profits.\u201d Adidas Kim detailed what he called \u201ctwo different but related schemes.\u201d The first  included coaches accepting bribes in exchange for directing players and their families toward those people, while the second  hinged on managers, advisers and Adidas representatives funneling more than $100,000 to the families of some of the nation\u2019s top high school basketball recruits in exchange for their commitment to a school sponsored by Adidas. \u201cWhile pushing these professionals, the bribed coaches showed little regard for the players\u2019 well-being. They ignored red flags, seeing only the green of the cash bribes flowing their way,\u201d Kim said. Person has been charged with six counts of conspiracy, fraud and solicitation of bribes. The FBI alleges that Person, a former NBA player, \u201cabused his coaching position \u2026 to solicit and obtain bribe payments from\u201d the financial adviser, who was secretly working with the bureau [FBI], in exchange for pushing athletes toward retaining the adviser\u2019s services when they entered the NBA. The scheme began with bribe payments arranged by Rashan Michel , who had a preexisting relationship with Person and founded a clothing company based in Atlanta that specializes in custom-made suits, according to the FBI. Person allegedly encouraged athletes to buy suits from Michel\u2019s company and sometimes set up the adviser to pay athletes\u2019 families directly, violating NCAA rules.\u00a0[Person allegedly told one player, \u201cThe most important part is that you \u2026 don\u2019t say nothing to anybody \u2026 don\u2019t share with your sisters, don\u2019t share with any of the teammates, that\u2019s very important \u2019cause this is a violation \u2026 of rules. But this is how the NBA players get it done.\u00a0They get early relationships, and they form partnerships, they form trust, you get to know [financial advisor], you get to know Rashan a lot and like Rashan can get you suits and stuff \u2026 you\u2019ll start looking like an NBA ball player, that\u2019s what you are.\u201d] Person was paid roughly $91,500 over a 10-month period and [gave] about $18,500 of those funds to families of two student-athletes \u2014 $11,000 to one athlete\u2019s mother and $7,500 to another \u2014 he directed toward the adviser, the FBI said. The bureau surveilled Person agreeing to a $50,000 bribe payment in November. A separate complaint details Bland, Evans and Richardson\u2019s counts of conspiracy and solicitation of bribes. Evans allegedly received at least $22,000 in bribe money in a scheme involving Christian Dawkins, a now-former Adidas employee  \u2026 and Munish Sood, founder of an investment services company , where he serves as its chief investment officer. \u2026\u00a0In exchange for the money, the FBI said, Evans exerted influence over his players at South Carolina and then Oklahoma State, where he currently coaches, to retain the services of Sood and the aforementioned financial adviser. Richardson allegedly received $20,000 in bribes either paid or facilitated by Dawkins and Sood. \u2026 In exchange for the money, the FBI said, Richardson pressured college players to retain Dawkins and Sood as their manager and financial adviser, respectively. And Bland accepted at least $13,000 in bribes paid or facilitated by Dawkins and Sood and allowed the two to send an additional $9,000 to the families of two athletes, the FBI said. \u2026.. The FBI quoted Dawkins boasting with others involved that they could \u201crun college basketball\u201d with their scheme. He was also recorded acknowledging that all payments couldn\u2019t be fully accounted for on paper because some of it was \u201cwhatever you wanna call it, illegal.\u201d \u2026  [During one recorded conversation between Dawkins, Sood and the FBI\u2019s informant, Dawkins stated that the easiest way to conduct such bribery schemes was through assistant coaches because head coaches \u201caren\u2019t willing [to take bribes] cause they\u2019re making too much money. And it\u2019s too risky.\u201d Plus, assistant coaches are better at getting \u201cdirect access\u201d to the players, as opposed to head coaches.] \u201cMonth after month, the defendants exploited the hoop dreams of student-athletes around the country, allegedly treating them as little more than opportunities to enrich themselves through bribery and fraud schemes,\u201d Kim said. \u201cFraud, abuse and corruption of the type alleged in the charges brought today contaminates all that is good and pure around it, and it has no place in college sports.\u201d Kim charged that the defendants\u2019 conduct \u201csullied the spirit of amateur athletics\u201d and \u201cshowed contempt\u201d for the thousands of players and coaches across the country who follow the rules and play the game the right way. \u201cAnd as many of them hit the hardwood floors later this week for college basketball\u2019s first official day of practice, we hope that these charges and arrests will help keep the sport that they love clean and honest,\u201d he added. William Sweeney, assistant director-in-charge of the FBI\u2019s New York Office , said the defendants all \u201ccontributed to a pay to play culture that has no business in college basketball\u201d and insisted that the charges should serve as a warning to others, as the investigation is ongoing. \u201cTo others choosing to conduct business this way in the world of college athletics,\u201d he said, \u201cwe have your playbook.\u201d From Politico .com.

Questions Background Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by Marisa Schultz, New York Post) \u2013 President Trump issued a new travel ban  Sunday evening to restrict visitors and immigrants from eight countries that have inadequate vetting procedures. \u201cMaking America Safe is my number one priority. We will not admit those into our country we cannot safely vet,\u201d Trump tweeted Sunday in announcing immigration policy. Trump\u2019s March 6 executive order that covered travelers from six countries \u2014 Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Sudan and Yemen \u2014 \u200bexpired Sunday evening. The new proclamation will maintain travel restrictions on Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen. Sudan has been dropped from the list. But traveling from three new countries will now be suspended and limited: Chad, North Korea and Venezuela. \u201cThese restrictions are both vital to national security and conditions based ,\u201d a senior Administration official said Sunday. The travel restrictions on the new countries will kick in at 12:01 am on Oct. 18. Guidelines will be sent to embassies and consulates on how to implement the new proclamation. The Supreme Court had already decided under the previous travel ban people with a \u201cbonafide\u201d relationship to the United States would still be welcomed and such waivers are expected to remain in place. Anyone with a valid visa currently will not have their travel documents revoked, senior Administration officials told reporters Sunday. This year, the Trump Administration conducted a worldwide review of countries\u2019 immigration and travel procedures to ensure national security. The Administration concluded seven countries don\u2019t meet standards for information sharing and screening to ensure visitors to the US don\u2019t pose a threat: Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Syria, Venezuela, and Yemen. The eighth, Somalia, \u201cgenerally satisfies\u201d the requirements, but restrictions were needed because of the \u201cgovernment\u2019s inability to effectively and consistently cooperate\u201d and the \u201csignificant\u201d terror threat emanating from the country, according to the president\u2019s proclamation. A ninth country \u2013 Iraq \u2014was also deemed not to meet the \u201cbaseline\u201d standards for vetting but the ally country won\u2019t be subject to the ban because of its unique counterterrorism and diplomatic relationship with the US. Countries will be removed from the travel ban when they meet the standards for information sharing on identifying their nationals. \u201cCountries may come off the list as we review them,\u201d another Administration official said. President Trump\u2019s initial travel ban has been subject to a Supreme Court challenge and nationwide protests by Democrats and liberals. He\u2019s stood firm on the need for extreme vetting. Asked Sunday about the new travel restrictions, the president said: \u201cThe travel ban: The tougher, the better.\u201d Reprinted here for educational purposes only.

Background From a DailyCaller article by Kevin Daley on September 24: Iranian nationals holding student or exchange visitor visas are unaffected by the order. Somali nationals may enter the United States, but may not emigrate on a permanent or semi-permanent basis. Officials further said no visas will be revoked as a result of Sunday\u2019s proclamation. In addition, all individuals with U.S. residency or green cards are also unaffected. \u2026 Administration officials say the decision to restrict travel to the countries named in the order was the product of a deliberative and collaborative  process involving U.S. security officials and foreign governments. All countries were informed of baseline security expectations  by the administration in July. While the original travel ban was in place, an interagency task force identified some 15 countries who fail to comply with U.S. security requirements. After consultation with the relevant foreign governments, that list was reduced to eight states, several of whom were described as intentionally noncompliant. The requirements in question include: robust  exchange of information related to public safety and terrorism acceptance of nationals deported from the U.S. and document security Document security refers to ensuring the integrity of visas and passports, fighting credential fraud, and sharing information about lost or stolen travel documents with U.S. and international law enforcement entities. Specific details as to the deficiencies of each country will not be made public given diplomatic and security sensitivities. A State Department official said detailed instructions to maintain and ensure compliance  with U.S. expectations have been wired to all American embassies. NOTE: The proclamation sets no guidance with respect to refugee resettlement. Though refugee entry is suspended under the president\u2019s initial order, the ban will expire later this year. Officials say new guidelines for refugee entry, including a figure on the total number of refugees the U.S. will accept for the coming fiscal year, will be released in a matter of days.

He described Puerto Rico as in \u2018very, very, very perilous shape\u2019 and said US emergency authorities were starting to work on helping in the recovery. CNN reports that Ricardo Ramos, the CEO of PREPA  said Puerto Ricans, might not get power back for four to six months.] In the U.S. Virgin islands, the majority of the 25,000 customers on St. Croix were also reported to be without power, the DOE report added. Energy support crews have been deployed to St. Thomas and St. Croix in support of Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) teams there, and others are prepared to deploy to Puerto Rico as soon as conditions permit, the DOE said. The said it was also bringing in utility and contractor crews from parts of the U.S. mainland to help with recovery efforts. American Public Power Association At least one support team is already in Puerto Rico, said Mike Hyland, senior vice president , engineering services at the association, in a phone interview. \u201cThey\u2019ve been in San Juan since Maria passed and I believe they\u2019re going today to St. Thomas. \u2026 Right now our mission is to get the lights back on,\u201d he said, adding that there were limited flights and barges serving the islands. The power outages have forced critical facilities, like hospitals, to rely on generators, and raised concerns about potential fuel shortages as some gas stations may not have backup power. \u201cThe fuel is there, you just can\u2019t pump it,\u201d said Patrick DeHaan, petroleum analyst at Gasbuddy. Maria killed at least 10 people as it raged through the Caribbean, the second major hurricane to do so this month. It packed winds of up to 155 mph, when it made landfall on Puerto Rico on Wednesday as the strongest storm to hit the U.S. territory in nearly 90 years. Maria\u2019s devastation comes just as Puerto Rico, which is facing the largest municipal debt crisis in U.S. history, and PREPA, which is bankrupt, were recovering from Hurricane Irma, which grazed the island, knocking out power to two-thirds of the residents. Petroleum supplies just under half of the island\u2019s electricity, and natural gas supplies nearly one-third, according to federal government data. In recent years, high world petroleum prices have driven typical Puerto Rican power prices as high as three times those in the U.S. mainland. Maria, which could strengthen somewhat over the next day or so, was forecast to move north in the Atlantic Ocean over the weekend, the NHC said.

Background How to help Puerto Rico: Samaritan\u2019s Purse  is a charity organization that does disaster relief in the U.S. and around the world.\u00a0Read about what they are doing to help at samaritanspurse.org . Samaritan\u2019s Purse  is run by Rev. Franklin Graham, the son of legendary evangelist Billy Graham. Franklin Graham said Samaritan\u2019s Purse has a large church connection with Puerto Rico. \u201cWe had a large meeting with hundreds of churches involved, so we have a network of pastors and churches that we work through,\u201d said Graham. \u201cThat\u2019s how we distribute in the community. The local church knows better than anyone where else the needs are. Where the elderly are, where the people that have lost everything are living, so we work with the churches.\u201d Graham noted that the group already had been working with those affected by Hurricanes Irma and Harvey, and have several large-scale items to move in for Maria. \u201cWe\u2019ve got 1,000 generators that were taken in; we\u2019ve ordered another 1,000,\u201d said Graham. \u201cWe\u2019ve got plastic tarps. These are heavy duty tarps that if the person lost their roof, they can put that on, and it will keep them in the dry. It\u2019s not a permanent fix, but it\u2019s a temporary solution. We\u2019ve got people there, we\u2019re just waiting for the airport to open.\u201d Resources Puerto Rico is curently a U.S. territory.

That is, amazingly, what the island has been doing for years now, giving the electricity used by municipalities to them for free. But the oil companies weren\u2019t giving said utility the oil so the costs just mounted and mounted. We might call this the Venezuelan mistake, ignoring the point of why we have proper markets in the first place. (by Tim Worstall, 7/3/17) From Associated Press by Danica Coto \u201cPuerto Rico faces weeks without electricity\u201d: In Puerto Rico, the grid was in sorry shape long before Maria \u2014 and Hurricane Irma two weeks ago \u2014 struck. The territory\u2019s $73 billion debt crisis has left agencies like the state power company broke. It abandoned most basic maintenance in recent years, leaving the island subject to regular blackouts. \u201cWe knew this was going to happen given the vulnerable infrastructure,\u201d Gov. Ricardo Rossello said. FEMA (the Federal Emergency Management Agency) said it would open an air bridge from the U.S. mainland on Friday, with three to four military planes flying to the island every day carrying water, food, generators and temporary shelters. \u201cThere\u2019s a humanitarian emergency here in Puerto Rico,\u201d Rossello said. \u201cThis is an event without precedent.\u201d He said his administration was trying to open ports soon to receive shipments of food, water, generators, cots and other supplies. The government has hired 56 small contractors to clear trees and put up new power lines and poles and will be sending tanker trucks to supply neighborhoods as they run out of water. The entire island has been declared a federal disaster zone. Mike Hyland, senior vice president of engineering services for the American Public Power Association, a utility industry group that is sending repair crews into the Caribbean, refused to speculate on how long it would take to restore power in Puerto Rico. \u201cLet\u2019s see what the facts tell us by the end of the weekend,\u201d he said. But he acknowledged: \u201cThis is going to be a tall lift.\u201d Cellphone and internet service collapsed in much of Puerto Rico. The only radio station that remained on the air during the hurricane \u2014 WAPA 680 AM \u2014 was relaying messages to help connect friends and families. Other concerns were more prosaic.

Questions Background Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions PART 2: Remarks by President Trump to the 72nd Session of the United Nations General Assembly on September 19, 2017: Below is the transcript from second half \u00a0of President Trump\u2019s address to the UN General Assembly in NYC on Sept. 19. \u00a0The President\u2019s speech was 41 minutes in length. Today\u2019s post (the second half of his speech), is divided into two parts to make it more manageable. (Watch the videos under \u201cResources\u201d below.) In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the leaders of more than 50 Arab and Muslim nations. \u00a0We agreed that all responsible nations must work together to confront terrorists and the Islamist extremism that inspires them. We will stop radical Islamic terrorism because we cannot allow it to tear up our nation, and indeed to tear up the entire world. We must deny the terrorists safe haven, transit, funding, and any form of support for their vile and sinister ideology. \u00a0We must drive them out of our nations. \u00a0It is time to expose and hold responsible those countries who support and finance terror groups like al Qaeda, Hezbollah, the Taliban and others that slaughter innocent people. The United States and our allies are working together throughout the Middle East to crush the loser terrorists and stop the reemergence of safe havens they use to launch attacks on all of our people. Last month, I announced a new strategy for victory in the fight against this evil in Afghanistan. \u00a0From now on, our security interests will dictate the length and scope of military operations, not arbitrary benchmarks and timetables set up by politicians. I have also totally changed the rules of engagement in our fight against the Taliban and other terrorist groups. \u00a0In Syria and Iraq, we have made big gains toward lasting defeat of ISIS. \u00a0In fact, our country has achieved more against ISIS in the last eight months than it has in many, many years combined. We seek the de-escalation of the Syrian conflict, and a political solution that honors the will of the Syrian people. \u00a0The actions of the criminal regime of Bashar al-Assad, including the use of chemical weapons against his own citizens \u2014 even innocent children \u2014 shock the conscience of every decent person. \u00a0No society can be safe if banned chemical weapons are allowed to spread. \u00a0That is why the United States carried out a missile strike on the airbase that launched the attack. We appreciate the efforts of United Nations agencies that are providing vital humanitarian assistance in areas liberated from ISIS, and we especially thank Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon for their role in hosting refugees from the Syrian conflict. The United States is a compassionate nation and has spent billions and billions of dollars in helping to support this effort. \u00a0We seek an approach to refugee resettlement that is designed to help these horribly treated people, and which enables their eventual return to their home countries, to be part of the rebuilding process. For the cost of resettling one refugee in the United States, we can assist more than 10 in their home region. \u00a0Out of the goodness of our hearts, we offer financial assistance to hosting countries in the region, and we support recent agreements of the G20 nations that will seek to host refugees as close to their home countries as possible. \u00a0This is the safe, responsible, and humanitarian approach. For decades, the United States has dealt with migration challenges here in the Western Hemisphere. \u00a0We have learned that, over the long term, uncontrolled migration is deeply unfair to both the sending and the receiving countries. For the sending countries, it reduces domestic pressure to pursue needed political and economic reform, and drains them of the human capital necessary to motivate and implement those reforms. For the receiving countries, the substantial costs of uncontrolled migration are borne overwhelmingly by low-income citizens whose concerns are often ignored by both media and government. I want to salute the work of the United Nations in seeking to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes. \u00a0The United Nations and African Union led peacekeeping missions to have invaluable contributions in stabilizing conflicts in Africa. \u00a0The United States continues to lead the world in humanitarian assistance, including famine prevention and relief in South Sudan, Somalia, and northern Nigeria and Yemen. We have invested in better health and opportunity all over the world through programs like PEPFAR, which funds AIDS relief; the President\u2019s Malaria Initiative; the Global Health Security Agenda; the Global Fund to End Modern Slavery; and the Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative, part of our commitment to empowering women all across the globe. We also thank \u2014 (applause) \u2014 we also thank the Secretary General for recognizing that the United Nations must reform if it is to be an effective partner in confronting threats to sovereignty, security, and prosperity. \u00a0Too often the focus of this organization has not been on results, but on bureaucracy and process. In some cases, states that seek to subvert this institution\u2019s noble aims have hijacked the very systems that are supposed to advance them. \u00a0For example, it is a massive source of embarrassment to the United Nations that some governments with egregious human rights records sit on the U.N. Human Rights Council. The United States is one out of 193 countries in the United Nations, and yet we pay 22 percent of the entire budget and more. \u00a0In fact, we pay far more than anybody realizes. \u00a0The United States bears an unfair cost burden, but, to be fair, if it could actually accomplish all of its stated goals, especially the goal of peace, this investment would easily be well worth it. Major portions of the world are in conflict and some, in fact, are going to hell. \u00a0But the powerful people in this room, under the guidance and auspices of the United Nations, can solve many of these vicious and complex problems. The American people hope that one day soon the United Nations can be a much more accountable and effective advocate for human dignity and freedom around the world. \u00a0In the meantime, we believe that no nation should have to bear a disproportionate share of the burden, militarily or financially. \u00a0Nations of the world must take a greater role in promoting secure and prosperous societies in their own regions. (Note: The above text can be viewed in VIDEO #3 \u00a0\u2013 found under \u201cRESOURCES\u201d below) CUBA That is why in the Western Hemisphere, the United States has stood against the corrupt and destabilizing regime in Cuba and embraced the enduring dream of the Cuban people to live in freedom. \u00a0My administration recently announced that we will not lift sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms. VENEZUELA We have also imposed tough, calibrated sanctions on the socialist Maduro regime in Venezuela, which has brought a once thriving nation to the brink of total collapse. The socialist dictatorship of Nicolas Maduro has inflicted terrible pain and suffering on the good people of that country. \u00a0This corrupt regime destroyed a prosperous nation by imposing a failed ideology that has produced poverty and misery everywhere it has been tried. \u00a0To make matters worse, Maduro has defied his own people, stealing power from their elected representatives to preserve his disastrous rule. The Venezuelan people are starving and their country is collapsing. \u00a0Their democratic institutions are being destroyed. \u00a0This situation is completely unacceptable and we cannot stand by and watch. As a responsible neighbor and friend, we and all others have a goal. \u00a0That goal is to help them regain their freedom, recover their country, and restore their democracy. \u00a0I would like to thank leaders in this room for condemning the regime and providing vital support to the Venezuelan people. The United States has taken important steps to hold the regime accountable. \u00a0We are prepared to take further action if the government of Venezuela persists on its path to impose authoritarian rule on the Venezuelan people. We are fortunate to have incredibly strong and healthy trade relationships with many of the Latin American countries gathered here today. \u00a0Our economic bond forms a critical foundation for advancing peace and prosperity for all of our people and all of our neighbors. I ask every country represented here today to be prepared to do more to address this very real crisis. \u00a0We call for the full restoration of democracy and political freedoms in Venezuela. (Applause.) The problem in Venezuela is not that socialism has been poorly implemented, but that socialism has been faithfully implemented. \u00a0(Applause.) \u00a0From the Soviet Union to Cuba to Venezuela, wherever true socialism or communism has been adopted, it has delivered anguish and devastation and failure. \u00a0Those who preach the tenets of these discredited ideologies only contribute to the continued suffering of the people who live under these cruel systems. America stands with every person living under a brutal regime. \u00a0Our respect for sovereignty is also a call for action. \u00a0All people deserve a government that cares for their safety, their interests, and their wellbeing, including their prosperity. ON TRADE In America, we seek stronger ties of business and trade with all nations of good will, but this trade must be fair and it must be reciprocal. For too long, the American people were told that mammoth multinational trade deals, unaccountable international tribunals, and powerful global bureaucracies were the best way to promote their success. \u00a0But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs vanished and thousands of factories disappeared. \u00a0Others gamed the system and broke the rules. \u00a0And our great middle class, once the bedrock of American prosperity, was forgotten and left behind, but they are forgotten no more and they will never be forgotten again. While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing our commitment to the first duty of every government: \u00a0the duty of our citizens. \u00a0This bond is the source of America\u2019s strength and that of every responsible nation represented here today. ON THE U.N. If this organization is to have any hope of successfully confronting the challenges before us, it will depend, as President Truman said some 70 years ago, on the \u201cindependent strength of its members.\u201d \u00a0If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and overcome the present dangers together, there can be no substitute for strong, sovereign, and independent nations \u2014 nations that are rooted in their histories and invested in their destinies; nations that seek allies to befriend, not enemies to conquer; and most important of all, nations that are home to patriots, to men and women who are willing to sacrifice for their countries, their fellow citizens, and for all that is best in the human spirit. In remembering the great victory that led to this body\u2019s founding, we must never forget that those heroes who fought against evil also fought for the nations that they loved. Patriotism led the Poles to die to save Poland, the French to fight for a free France, and the Brits to stand strong for Britain. Today, if we do not invest ourselves, our hearts, and our minds in our nations, if we will not build strong families, safe communities, and healthy societies for ourselves, no one can do it for us. We cannot wait for someone else, for faraway countries or far-off bureaucrats \u2014 we can\u2019t do it. \u00a0We must solve our problems, to build our prosperity, to secure our futures, or we will be vulnerable to decay, domination, and defeat. The true question for the United Nations today, for people all over the world who hope for better lives for themselves and their children, is a basic one: \u00a0Are we still patriots? \u00a0Do we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty and to take ownership of their futures? \u00a0Do we revere them enough to defend their interests, preserve their cultures, and ensure a peaceful world for their citizens? One of the greatest American patriots, John Adams, wrote that the American Revolution was \u201ceffected before the war commenced. \u00a0The Revolution was in the minds and hearts of the people.\u201d That was the moment when America awoke, when we looked around and understood that we were a nation. \u00a0We realized who we were, what we valued, and what we would give our lives to defend. \u00a0From its very first moments, the American story is the story of what is possible when people take ownership of their future. The United States of America has been among the greatest forces for good in the history of the world, and the greatest defenders of sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all. Now we are calling for a great reawakening of nations, for the revival of their spirits, their pride, their people, and their patriotism. History is asking us whether we are up to the task. \u00a0Our answer will be a renewal of will, a rediscovery of resolve, and a rebirth of devotion. \u00a0We need to defeat the enemies of humanity and unlock the potential of life itself. Our hope is a word and world of proud, independent nations that embrace their duties, seek friendship, respect others, and make common cause in the greatest shared interest of all: \u00a0a future of dignity and peace for the people of this wonderful Earth. This is the true vision of the United Nations, the ancient wish of every people, and the deepest yearning that lives inside every sacred soul. So let this be our mission, and let this be our message to the world: \u00a0We will fight together, sacrifice together, and stand together for peace, for freedom, for justice, for family, for humanity, and for the almighty God who made us all. Thank you. \u00a0God bless you. \u00a0God bless the nations of the world. \u00a0And God bless the United States of America. \u00a0Thank you very much. \u00a0(Applause.)

Today\u2019s post (the first half of his speech), is divided into two parts to make it more manageable. (Watch the videos under \u201cResources\u201d below.) PRESIDENT TRUMP:  \u00a0Mr. Secretary General, Mr. President, world leaders, and distinguished delegates: \u00a0Welcome to New York. \u00a0It is a profound honor to stand here in my home city, as a representative of the American people, to address the people of the world. As millions of our citizens continue to suffer the effects of the devastating hurricanes that have struck our country, I want to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in this room who has offered assistance and aid. \u00a0The American people are strong and resilient, and they will emerge from these hardships more determined than ever before. Fortunately, the United States has done very well since Election Day last November 8th. \u00a0The stock market is at an all-time high \u2014 a record. \u00a0Unemployment is at its lowest level in 16 years, and because of our regulatory and other reforms, we have more people working in the United States today than ever before. \u00a0Companies are moving back, creating job growth the likes of which our country has not seen in a very long time. \u00a0And it has just been announced that we will be spending almost $700 billion on our military and defense. Our military will soon be the strongest it has ever been. \u00a0For more than 70 years, in times of war and peace, the leaders of nations, movements, and religions have stood before this assembly. \u00a0Like them, I intend to address some of the very serious threats before us today but also the enormous potential waiting to be unleashed. We live in a time of extraordinary opportunity. \u00a0Breakthroughs in science, technology, and medicine are curing illnesses and solving problems that prior generations thought impossible to solve. But each day also brings news of growing dangers that threaten everything we cherish and value. \u00a0Terrorists and extremists have gathered strength and spread to every region of the planet. \u00a0Rogue regimes represented in this body not only support terrorists but threaten other nations and their own people with the most destructive weapons known to humanity. Authority and authoritarian powers seek to collapse the values, the systems, and alliances that prevented conflict and tilted the world toward freedom since World War II. International criminal networks traffic drugs, weapons, people; force dislocation and mass migration; threaten our borders; and new forms of aggression exploit technology to menace our citizens. To put it simply, we meet at a time of both of immense promise and great peril. \u00a0It is entirely up to us whether we lift the world to new heights, or let it fall into a valley of disrepair. We have it in our power, should we so choose, to lift millions from poverty, to help our citizens realize their dreams, and to ensure that new generations of children are raised free from violence, hatred, and fear. This institution was founded in the aftermath of two world wars to help shape this better future. \u00a0It was based on the vision that diverse nations could cooperate to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security, and promote their prosperity. It was in the same period, exactly 70 years ago, that the United States developed the Marshall Plan to help restore Europe. \u2026 The Marshall Plan was built on the noble idea that the whole world is safer when nations are strong, independent, and free. \u00a0As President Truman said in his message to Congress at that time, \u201cOur support of European recovery is in full accord with our support of the United Nations. \u00a0The success of the United Nations depends upon the independent strength of its members.\u201d To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the promise of the future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past. \u00a0Our success depends on a coalition of strong and independent nations that embrace their to promote security, prosperity, and peace for themselves and for the world. sovereignty We do not expect diverse countries to share the same cultures, traditions, or even systems of government. \u00a0But we do expect all nations to uphold these two core sovereign duties: \u00a0to respect the interests of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation. \u00a0This is the beautiful vision of this institution, and this is foundation for cooperation and success. Strong, sovereign nations let diverse countries with different values, different cultures, and different dreams not just coexist, but work side by side on the basis of mutual respect. Strong, sovereign nations let their people take ownership of the future and control their own destiny. And strong, sovereign nations allow individuals to flourish in the fullness of the life intended by God. In America, we do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to watch. \u00a0This week gives our country a special reason to take pride in that example. \u00a0We are celebrating the 230th anniversary of our beloved Constitution \u2014 the oldest constitution still in use in the world today. This timeless document has been the foundation of peace, prosperity, and freedom for the Americans and for countless millions around the globe whose own countries have found inspiration in its respect for human nature, human dignity, and the rule of law. The greatest in the United States Constitution is its first three beautiful words. \u00a0They are: \u00a0\u201cWe the people.\u201d Generations of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of those words, the promise of our country, and of our great history. \u00a0In America, the people govern, the people rule, and the people are sovereign. \u00a0I was elected not to take power, but to give power to the American people, where it belongs. In foreign affairs, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty. \u00a0Our government\u2019s first duty is to its people, to our citizens \u2014 to serve their needs, to ensure their safety, to preserve their rights, and to defend their values. As President of the United States, I will always put America first, just like you, as the leaders of your countries will always, and should always, put your countries first. \u00a0(Applause.) All responsible leaders have an obligation to serve their own citizens, and the nation-state remains the best vehicle for elevating the human condition. But making a better life for our people also requires us to work together in close harmony and unity to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people. The United States will forever be a great friend to the world, and especially to its allies. \u00a0But we can no longer be taken advantage of, or enter into a one-sided deal where the United States gets nothing in return. \u00a0As long as I hold this office, I will defend America\u2019s interests above all else. But in fulfilling our obligations to our own nations, we also realize that it\u2019s in everyone\u2019s interest to seek a future where all nations can be sovereign, prosperous, and secure. America does more than speak for the values expressed in the United Nations Charter. \u00a0Our citizens have paid the ultimate price to defend our freedom and the freedom of many nations represented in this great hall. \u00a0America\u2019s devotion is measured on the battlefields where our young men and women have fought and sacrificed alongside of our allies, from the beaches of Europe to the deserts of the Middle East to the jungles of Asia. It is an eternal credit to the American character that even after we and our allies emerged victorious from the bloodiest war in history, we did not seek territorial expansion, or attempt to oppose and impose our way of life on others. \u00a0Instead, we helped build institutions such as this one to defend the sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all. For the diverse nations of the world, this is our hope. \u00a0We want harmony and friendship, not conflict and strife. \u00a0We are guided by outcomes, not ideology. \u00a0We have a policy of principled realism, rooted in shared goals, interests, and values. That realism forces us to confront a question facing every leader and nation in this room. \u00a0It is a question we cannot escape or avoid. \u00a0We will slide down the path of complacency, numb to the challenges, threats, and even wars that we face. \u00a0Or do we have enough strength and pride to confront those dangers today, so that our citizens can enjoy peace and prosperity tomorrow? If we desire to lift up our citizens, if we aspire to the approval of history, then we must fulfill our sovereign duties to the people we faithfully represent. \u00a0We must protect our nations, their interests, and their futures. \u00a0We must reject threats to sovereignty, from the Ukraine to the South China Sea. \u00a0We must uphold respect for law, respect for borders, and respect for culture, and the peaceful engagement these allow. \u00a0And just as the founders of this body intended, we must work together and confront together those who threaten us with chaos, turmoil, and terror. The scourge of our planet today is a small group of rogue regimes that violate every principle on which the United Nations is based. \u00a0They respect neither their own citizens nor the sovereign rights of their countries. If the righteous many do not confront the wicked few, then evil will triumph. \u00a0When decent people and nations become bystanders to history, the forces of destruction only gather power and strength. (Note: The above text can be viewed in VIDEO #1; The text below can be viewed in VIDEO #2 \u2013 both found under \u201cRESOURCES\u201d below) NORTH KOREA No one has shown more contempt for other nations and for the wellbeing of their own people than the depraved regime in North Korea. \u00a0It is responsible for the starvation deaths of millions of North Koreans, and for the imprisonment, torture, killing, and oppression of countless more. We were all witness to the regime\u2019s deadly abuse when an innocent American college student, Otto Warmbier, was returned to America only to die a few days later. \u00a0We saw it in the assassination of the dictator\u2019s brother using banned nerve agents in an international airport. \u00a0We know it kidnapped a sweet 13-year-old Japanese girl from a beach in her own country to enslave her as a language tutor for North Korea\u2019s spies. If this is not twisted enough, now North Korea\u2019s reckless pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles threatens the entire world with unthinkable loss of human life. It is an outrage that some nations would not only trade with such a regime, but would arm, supply, and financially support a country that imperils the world with nuclear conflict. \u00a0No nation on earth has an interest in seeing this band of criminals arm itself with nuclear weapons and missiles. The United States has great strength and patience, but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea. \u00a0Rocket Man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime. \u00a0The United States is ready, willing and able, but hopefully this will not be necessary. \u00a0That\u2019s what the United Nations is all about; that\u2019s what the United Nations is for. \u00a0Let\u2019s see how they do. It is time for North Korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future. \u00a0The United Nations Security Council recently held two unanimous 15-0 votes adopting hard-hitting resolutions against North Korea, and I want to thank China and Russia for joining the vote to impose sanctions, along with all of the other members of the Security Council. \u00a0Thank you to all involved. But we must do much more. \u00a0It is time for all nations to work together to isolate the Kim regime until it ceases its hostile behavior. IRAN We face this decision not only in North Korea. \u00a0It is far past time for the nations of the world to confront another reckless regime \u2014 one that speaks openly of mass murder, vowing death to America, destruction to Israel, and ruin for many leaders and nations in this room. The Iranian government masks a corrupt dictatorship behind the false guise of a democracy. \u00a0It has turned a wealthy country with a rich history and culture into an economically depleted rogue state whose chief exports are violence, bloodshed, and chaos. \u00a0The longest-suffering victims of Iran\u2019s leaders are, in fact, its own people. Rather than use its resources to improve Iranian lives, its oil profits go to fund Hezbollah and other terrorists that kill innocent Muslims and attack their peaceful Arab and Israeli neighbors. \u00a0This wealth, which rightly belongs to Iran\u2019s people, also goes to shore up Bashar al-Assad\u2019s dictatorship, fuel Yemen\u2019s civil war, and undermine peace throughout the entire Middle East. We cannot let a murderous regime continue these destabilizing activities while building dangerous missiles, and we cannot abide by an agreement if it provides cover for the eventual construction of a nuclear program. \u00a0(Applause.) \u00a0The Iran Deal was one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into. \u00a0Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States, and I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve heard the last of it \u2014 believe me. It is time for the entire world to join us in demanding that Iran\u2019s government end its pursuit of death and destruction. \u00a0It is time for the regime to free all Americans and citizens of other nations that they have unjustly detained. \u00a0And above all, Iran\u2019s government must stop supporting terrorists, begin serving its own people, and respect the sovereign rights of its neighbors. The entire world understands that the good people of Iran want change, and, other than the vast military power of the United States, that Iran\u2019s people are what their leaders fear the most. \u00a0This is what causes the regime to restrict Internet access, tear down satellite dishes, shoot unarmed student protestors, and imprison political reformers. Oppressive regimes cannot endure forever, and the day will come when the Iranian people will face a choice. \u00a0Will they continue down the path of poverty, bloodshed, and terror? \u00a0Or will the Iranian people return to the nation\u2019s proud roots as a center of civilization, culture, and wealth where their people can be happy and prosperous once again? The Iranian regime\u2019s support for terror is in stark contrast to the recent commitments of many of its neighbors to fight terrorism and halt its financing. \u2026..

Background The Marshall Plan\u00a0 was an American initiative to aid Western Europe, in which the United States gave over $13 billion (approximately $130 billion in current dollar value as of June 2016) in economic support to help rebuild Western European economies after the end of World War II. The plan was in operation for four years beginning on April 8, 1948. The goals of the United States were to rebuild war-devastated regions, remove trade barriers, modernize industry, make Europe prosperous once more, and prevent the spread of communism.

Questions Background Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by Steve Dorsey, CBS News) \u2013 The top official in charge of security for the U.S. embassy in Havana, Cuba, is among at least 21 Americans affected by mysterious attacks that have triggered a range of injuries, according to two sources who are familiar with the incidents but were not authorized to speak publicly about them. Identified as the Regional Security Officer , the position is responsible for serving as the embassy\u2019s senior law enforcement and security adviser interfacing with foreign police. Regional Security Officers are key members of the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Diplomatic Security overseeing the safety and security of each U.S. embassy and their personnel. CBS News is not yet naming the Regional Security Officer, who was scheduled to undergo medical treatment, according to a source. When contacted by CBS News, the individual declined to comment. The development illustrates how far-reaching the attacks have been, affecting one of the most senior leaders of the U.S. embassy that only reopened in 2015. CBS News Radio broke the story last month. Last week,\u00a0five Republican senators on the Senate Intelligence Committee , including Chairman Richard Burr, sent a letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson  calling on him to expel all accredited Cuban diplomats in the U.S. and consider closing the embassy in Havana. \u201cCuba\u2019s neglect of its duty to protect our diplomats and their families cannot go unchallenged,\u201d the senators wrote. Tillerson responded on CBS News\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d Sunday. \u201cWe have it under evaluation,\u201d Tillerson said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very serious issue with respect to the harm that certain individuals have suffered. We\u2019ve brought some of those people home. It\u2019s under review.\u201d Although the U.S. has not publicly blamed Cuba for the attacks, on May 23, the State Department asked two Cuban embassy officials in Washington to leave the country. A source identified them as\u2026intelligence officials. They departed the U.S. a week later, on May 30. Cuba has denied any involvement. Cuba\u2019s communist leader Raul Castro, brother of former leader Fidel Castro. (Photo: AP) Cuba\u2019s President Ra\u00fal Castro  suggested to then-Ambassador Jeffry DeLaurentis in February that the attacks could have been caused by a \u201crogue element,\u201d according to a source with knowledge of the conversation. But, \u201cnothing happens in that island without a Castro giving it the OK,\u201d according to the source. Ra\u00fal Castro\u2019s only son, 52-year-old Col. Alejando Castro Esp\u00edn , is a high-ranking official in Cuba\u2019s intelligence apparatus. Some analysts and sources close the U.S. investigation of the attacks have pointed to the possibility that a third country is behind the attacks, perhaps a U.S. adversary like Iran, North Korea or Russia. \u2026 Diplomats have been treated for mild traumatic brain injury and permanent hearing loss, according to the American Foreign Service Association and medical records examined by CBS News. They\u2019ve also complained of nausea, headaches, exhaustion and trouble concentrating and remembering words. The attacks began in late 2016, and the latest one was reported August 21. There are few patterns among the Americans affected by the attacks, which may have been caused by covert acoustic devices targeting their homes rented from the Cuban government and at four Havana hotels. Diplomats have told investigators that during some attacks, they heard excruciatingly loud noises \u2014 like something from an insect, but that they believed other attacks \u2014 often at night \u2014 were silent. The 15 men and 6 women include a broad mix of first-tour and multiple-tour officers. Some had been in Havana longer than others, but none more than two years \u2014 most less than a year. They have been treated by medical professionals in Havana, at the University of Miami and elsewhere in the U.S. \u2026 Len Tepper in New York, Portia Siegelbaum in Havana, and Svetlana Berdnikova in Moscow contributed to this report.

As president-elect, Trump called the U.N. \u201cjust a club for people to get together, talk and have a good time.\u201d\u00a0But it\u2019s a \u201cnew day\u201d at the U.N., said .

But, unlike past presidents, Trump is promoting his \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda, and he has called for slashing U.S. financial contributions to the U.N.  [Reuters reports that the United States is the biggest U.N. contributor, providing 22 percent of its $5.4 billion biennial core budget and 28.5 percent of its $7.3 billion peacekeeping budget. The contributions are agreed on by the 193-member General Assembly, of which the U.S. has one vote.] \u2026 The Trump administration is also shrinking the size of the diplomatic delegation at this year\u2019s U.N. summit. Trump administration officials explained it as another a cost-saving measure\u2026. Ambassador Haley stated that the U.S. approach at the U.N. summit would be \u201csolid\u201d and \u201cstrong,\u201d as diplomats and top U.S. officials tackle global challenges. \u201cThere are no shortage of issues, with North Korea being front and center,\u201d said Haley. \u201cIran will be an issue. Syria will certainly be talked about. Terrorism efforts and how we counter that is a huge topic.\u201d The president is expected to address some of those issues on Tuesday when he takes the lectern at the U.N. to address world leaders. [He\u00a0is scheduled to be the second speaker.] Haley confirmed that she has read a draft of the speech.\u00a0\u201cI personally think he slaps the right people, he hugs the right people, and he comes out with [the] U.S. being very strong in the end,\u201d she said. [\u201cI think he will make quite an impact.\u201d].  [ Also of note,  on Monday President Trump will host an event at U.N. headquarters with the intent of gaining support for his reform proposals. Haley said 120 countries had agreed to attend the President\u2019s meeting , at which Trump will propose a \u201cmassive reform package\u201d that will make the U.N. \u201cmore effective.\u201d \u00a0This follows the president\u2019s calls for a reform of the U.N. to lower \u201cout-of-control costs.\u201d \u00a0Countries were invited to attend after signing on to a U.S.-drafted 10-point political declaration backing efforts by \u201cto initiate effective, meaningful reform,\u201d according to a draft of the political declaration seen by Reuters on Sept. 8th.

Questions Background Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by Meagan Flynn, Houston Press) \u2013 Houston City Councilman Dave Martin  had some harsh words for the American Red Cross at a council meeting on Wednesday (Sept. 6) and urged Houstonians to give their money and supplies to other organizations. Repeatedly calling the Red Cross the \u201cRed Loss,\u201d Martin said it has been local government that has done all of the heavy lifting at the shelters and that has provided most of the resources \u2014 \u201cyet every time I turn on the TV, I see [the Red Cross] taking in millions of dollars in donations,\u201d Martin said. He said the Red Cross was the \u201cmost inept, unorganized organization I\u2019ve ever experienced.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t waste your time, don\u2019t waste your money [donating to the Red Cross],\u201d he said. \u201cGive it to another cause.\u201d The Texas Gulf Coast Red Cross chapter  did not immediately return a request for comment about the resources it has specifically devoted to Houston-area shelters. Other council members clarified later that the city strongly supported the thousands of individual Red Cross volunteers across the region working at the shelters and elsewhere. In recent years, the criticism lobbed at the Red Cross has mostly been reserved instead for the and how it has used millions in donations to actually help victims of natural disasters. upper administration The criticism mounted most pointedly in 2015, after NPR and ProPublica released a series of damning reports targeting how the Red Cross responded to the hurricane that devastated Haiti in 2010. In their joint investigation, the news outlets found that despite claiming it had provided homes to more than 130,000 people, the Red Cross had built just six homes. (The Red Cross told the outlets that it had completed more than 100 projects in Haiti and repaired 4,000 homes, but refused to provide a list of the projects and the costs.) \u201cIn Search of the Red Cross\u2019 $500 Million in Haiti Relief,\u201d NPR and ProPublica found that much of the $488 million in donations was handed off to third-party organizations, which then did the actual boots-on-the-ground work \u2014 but not before the Red Cross reserved some of the money for its own administrative fees. A subsequent report commissioned by U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) found that (25%) one quarter of the $488 million went to the nonprofit\u2019s internal expenses. Just a week ago, NPR pressed American Red Cross executive Brad Kieserman  about what percentage of the money people donate for Hurricane Harvey relief will actually end up helping the flood victims \u2014 but he did not know. [He said,\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t think I know the answer to that any better than the chief fundraiser knows how many, how much it costs to put a volunteer downrange for a week and how many emergency response vehicles I have on the road today. So I think if he was on this interview and you were asking how many relief vehicles in Texas, I don\u2019t think he\u2019d know the answer and I don\u2019t know the answer to the financial question I\u2019m afraid.\u201d]\u00a0\u2026..

NPR added a note to its Aug. 30 report on the Red Cross: Editor\u2019s note on Sept. 1:  Some listeners and readers have asked why NPR pressed Red Cross operations and logistics executive Brad Kieserman about how much of the money his organization receives will actually be spent on helping those affected by Hurricane Harvey. NPR\u2019s questions were follow-ups to several years of reporting by NPR and ProPublica about shortcomings in the organization\u2019s disaster relief operations and misleading claims about its finances. NPR has asked several times in recent years to speak with Red Cross President and CEO Gail J. McGovern. Those requests have been turned down. Prior to this latest interview, NPR asked again. The organization said McGovern was unavailable, but did make Kieserman available. The San Diego Union Tribune reported on Aug. 31: Past reports by NPR and ProPublica over how much of the agency\u2019s money goes to actual disaster relief. Here\u2019s what some of those investigations have uncovered: 26 cents of every dollar donated go to overhead costs, not 9 cents as the agency claims ( ProPublica ) The Red Cross raised half a billion dollars only to build six homes after the 2010 earthquake in Haiti ( ProPublica ) The agency took emergency vehicles away from relief work to be used as backdrops for press conferences during Superstorm Sandy  in 2012 ( ProPublica ) From a report by Vox on September 6, 2017: \u2026Journalist Jonathan Katz \u2026 who was the Associated Press\u2019s bureau chief in Haiti during the 2010 earthquake (and later wrote a book about it), argued that the Red Cross \u201chas proven itself unequal to the task of massive disaster relief.\u201d The problem, as Katz sees it, is that the Red Cross is a dysfunctional organization that excels at raising money but has shown little evidence of its ability to spend that money wisely or meaningfully. The Red Cross takes in close to 3 billion annually, refuses to open its books to the public, and, according to Katz, has consistently failed to produce a useful breakdown of its spending after major disaster efforts. They\u2019re also limited in terms of what they can do on the ground. The Red Cross isn\u2019t a development organization \u2014 they don\u2019t rebuild schools or hospitals or infrastructure. They provide short-term relief \u2014 cots for people to sleep on, blankets to keep them warm, hygiene kits, etc. This kind of work is important, Katz says, but it doesn\u2019t justify the enormous sums of money the Red Cross solicits from the public. \u2026 What the Red Cross does well is position very short-term relief in certain kinds of situations. They\u2019re better at it in a very small-scale disaster, where basic logistical networks aren\u2019t being affected. So if there\u2019s a single house fire or something like that, they can be effective. But in terms of broader disaster relief, they really don\u2019t do much apart from raising money. So in Haiti, for example, where I worked, this was a big issue. The Red Cross raised tons of money but had no idea what to do with it, or how to make it work for the people who needed it. They raised something like half a billion dollars and they had no way to spend it. They did not have half a billion dollars\u2019 worth of things to do. So in a situation like that, especially in an overseas disaster, all of that was a complete waste. Almost all of that money could have been better spent somewhere else. Resources On Wednesday, September 6, Houston Councilman Dave Martin commended San Antonio for help after Hurricane Harvey. He also urged people not to donate to the Red Cross. In fact, Mr. Martin said he \u201cbeg(s) you not to send them a penny.\u201d https://www.studentnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Houston-Councilman-Dave-Martin-2017-Sept-6.mp4 Recent Daily News Articles Veterans Day 2017: Vets Plan To Boycott NFL Games On Sunday November 10, 2017 EPA approves bacteria-infected insects to kill mosquitoes November 9, 2017 Pa. officials still mostly mum on noncitizens registered to vote November 8, 2017 Tuesday\u2019s World News #1 \u2013 Lebanon November 7, 2017 US deserter Bowe Bergdahl spared prison time November 6, 2017 Get the App Follow Us Elsewhere About  \u00a0\u2014 Site Overview  \u00a0\u2014 Contact Us  \u00a0\u2014 Donate Launched in 2005, StudentNewsDaily.com is a 501(c)3 non-profit educational website.

Questions Background Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by Byron Tau, The Wall Street Journal) \u2013\u00a0Election administrators in Virginia ordered the state\u2019s remaining touch-screen electronic voting machines  be taken out of service in advance of the coming statewide election, after hackers demonstrated vulnerabilities in an array of election technology at a recent security convention. Virginia, one of two states holding statewide elections for governor and state legislature this year, won\u2019t use any touch-screen machines in the Nov. 7 general election after the State Board of Elections voted Friday to revoke the certifications on all such systems still being used in the state. Virginia will switch to paper ballots counted and processed by computerized scanners. [Voting machines\u00a0that record votes on paper instead of only electronically, allow the votes to be audited and verified.] James Alcorn, chair of the board, said in a statement the move was \u201cnecessary to ensure the integrity of Virginia\u2019s elections.\u201d \u2026 Virginia\u2019s decision came after one of the state\u2019s electronic voting machines was hacked in less than two hours at the DEF CON hacking and security convention in Las Vegas in July. As part of a security demonstration on the vulnerabilities of election technology, hackers cracked a machine last used in a 2014 election in Fairfax County, Va., by exploiting a security flaw that has been known to systems administrators for more than a decade, but had not been patched on the voting system. Harri Hursti, a co-coordinator of a weekend-long Voting Machine Hacking Village event at the DefCon computer security conference in Las Vegas. Hursti is a partner at Nordic Innovation Labs and an expert on election security issues. (Photo: USA Today / Elizabeth Weise) Though the model that was hacked at the conference was already decertified by the state and wasn\u2019t used in the 2016 election, the state still allowed use of seven other kinds of electronic voting machines until this month. The Virginia Department of Elections specifically cited the conference in a recommendation to the state board as a reason to end the use of electronic voting machines. The decision by the board gives the state\u2019s jurisdictions that still use touch-screen electronic machines just eight weeks to obtain and deploy new technology. Administrators noted just 140 precincts serving roughly 190,000 of Virginia\u2019s five million voters will be affected by the decision. Most jurisdictions in the state have already eliminated the technology. \u2026 The decision by Virginia to stop using touch-screen electronic voting machines marks a victory for advocates who have long criticized paperless electronic voting systems as insecure and potentially vulnerable to tampering and mischief. \u201cPaperless voting machines with no paper backups should never have been used in the first place,\u201d said Barbara Simons , president of the nonpartisan group Verified Voting  that advocates for a paper trail and random audits. She said she hoped other states would follow Virginia\u2019s lead in eliminating systems with no paper backups to bolster security and public confidence in their elections. Use of touch-screen machines peaked in 2006, according to data from the Pew Research Center and Verified Voting. Most voters now use what are called optical-scan systems \u2014voting by paper ballots that are then scanned and counted by computerized scanners. Other electronic voting machines also have paper backups in response to concerns about integrity. The Hart Intercivic eScan is a precinct-based, digital ballot scanning system. After marking a paper ballot, the voter feeds it directly into the eScan at the precinct. The ballot image is stored as a Cast Vote Record (CVR) on a flash memory card that can be retrieved and tabulated when the polls close. (VerifiedVoting.org) [Touchscreen machines are still in use in several states, including New Jersey, Georgia, and Pennsylvania.]\u00a0Verified Voting estimates that 20% to 25% of the U.S. population still votes on electronic machine with no paper backups. Questions 1. The first paragraph of a news article should answer the questions who, what, where and when. List the who, what, where and when of this news item. (NOTE: The remainder of a news article provides details on the why and/or how.) 2. Why did Virginia\u2019s Board of Elections vote to eliminate the state\u2019s remaining touch-screen electronic voting machines? 3. For what reason has the Board moved to replace touch-screen machines with ones that record votes on paper instead of only electronically? 4. a) What is important to note about the voting machine that was hacked at DEF CON this year? b) How many Virginia voters will be affected by the change in voting machines? 5. a) What is an optical-scan system for voting? b) What percentage of U.S. voters still vote on electronic machines with no paper backups, according to the group Verified Voting? 6. Optical scan voting systems can allow for manual recounting of ballots and random auditing of the election equipment that reports the results to election officials. Statistically relevant auditing can serve as a tool to detect or deter malfunction or fraud. In the instance where a candidate is entitled to a recount, a full hand recount of paper ballots can determine the accurate, or final results. Officials responsible for maintaining the veracity and accuracy of elections such as election commissioners or county auditors, can randomly select a voting block such as a precinct to verify the optical scanning voting system tabulation and report is accurate by doing a hand count against the machine\u2019s results. By performing such an audit, election officials can confirm the system is in good standing. Or, if an error in the counting is discovered during a random audit of the machine(s), a full recount can be conducted, and the system evaluated for the source of failure or fraud. Should voters in every state demand that their state and municipality use an optical scan voting system? Explain your answer. 7. Voter fraud and election hacking should both be prevented by the states. In addition to securing the actual votes, steps must be taken to ensure that only registered voters are voting (no voting in two places, or deceased people voting, or ineligible people voting). Measures like Voter ID laws have been taken to ensure only registered voters are voting. A total of 34 states have laws requesting or requiring voters to show some form of identification at the polls. Another way to prevent voter fraud is to clean the voter rolls. Liberals/Democrats oppose Voter ID laws because they say requiring ID discriminates against and disenfranchises* minority and elderly voters, who they say do not have, or are not able to afford, ID \u2013 especially a drivers license. (*Disenfranchise: to prevent (a person or group of people) from having the right to vote). They also say this type of voter fraud is minimal or non-existent. Conservatives/Republicans refute this by listing all of the things people need to show ID for (doctor, banking, school, government assistance\u2026), as well as saying people who can\u2019t afford an identification card should be provided one for free from the government \u2013 that it does not have to be a drivers license. They say it will prevent voter fraud. What do you think: a) Does voter fraud exist? Explain your answer. b) Are Voter ID laws a good way to prevent voter fraud, or are they discriminatory and prevent certain groups of people from voting?

Questions Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by Mary Wisniewski, Chicago Tribune) \u2013\u00a0Cars soaked by floodwaters from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma\u00a0will soon start appearing in the used car market, so buyers should beware, according to vehicle experts. \u201cEven brick-and-mortar legitimate dealers can get burned buying flooded vehicles,\u201d said Frank Scafidi, spokesman for the National Insurance Crime Bureau , a Des Plaines-based nonprofit that fights insurance fraud and crime. \u201cIf a professional can get burned, you can too.\u201d Flood damage is easier to conceal from an untrained eye than damage from a wreck, but it can be more devastating to the engine and other key components, said Christopher Basso, spokesman for the used car research firm Carfax . Flooding can destroy a car\u2019s electronic system, affecting safety features like air bags and anti-lock brakes, while rust can rot the vehicle from the inside, Basso said. Scafidi expects the number of flood-damaged cars to be greater for Harvey than it was for Hurricane Katrina in 2005, both because of Harvey\u2019s bigger footprint and because in the last 12 years more vehicles rely on computer technology and electronics. \u201cBeneath the surface, water can permanently damage computers that control everything from the gas pedal to steering,\u201d said Cliff Wood, chief operating officer at CarMax , a leading used car dealer. Hurricane Katrina in 2005 damaged about 600,000 vehicles, Basso said. Carfax is still working on an estimate for Harvey. About half of flood-damaged cars are resold. Some sellers do not have insurance and clean the cars up to try to get what they can from them, Basso said. It is not illegal to sell or buy a flood-damaged car, as long as both parties are aware, Scafidi said. But some sellers conceal the damage and offer a nice-looking car at a suspiciously low price. \u201cWith flood vehicles, it creates an opportunity for people in that business to scam innocent buyers who may have been researching used car purchases for some time and looking at a make and model and suddenly, there\u2019s that make and model that\u2019s just terrifically priced \u2014 it was $25,000 and now it\u2019s $12,000,\u201d said Scafidi. \u2026 Since Hurricane Katrina, the National Insurance Crime Bureau has offered a free vehicle identification number (VIN) \u00a0check service to see if a car has been in a flood. The service is available at www.nicb.org/vincheck . A VIN also can be entered into the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System database at www.vehiclehistory.gov . Carfax, which charges $39.99 for a report, is offering its flood-damage database for free post-Harvey. Buyers can check if a car is flood-damaged at carfax.com/flood. A database check is not always enough. Some flood-damaged cars are missed by title and VIN checks, because a car can be bought cheap, cleaned and then taken out of state where a VIN is switched and the car is retitled with no indication that it has been damaged, Scafidi said. Basso recommends taking a vehicle to a trusted mechanic and going for a test drive. He said buyers should look for water lines and signs of debris or salt in the trunk and engine compartment. \u201cThe biggest giveaway on the inside of the car is you see rust build-up on the seat rails, on the nuts and bolts, and the seat belts,\u201d Basso said. Flooded vehicles also can pose health risks because they sat in water that was not clean, which can penetrate the seats and carpet, causing a build-up of bacteria, Basso said. Larry Doll, legal counsel for the Illinois Automobile Dealers Association, a trade group,\u00a0recommends giving used cars a \u201csmell test.\u201d \u201cClose the windows for a few hours to see if there\u2019s a rusty, mildew smell,\u201d he said. Buyers also can protect themselves by buying from a reputable dealer rather than off some ad site like Craigslist, Scafidi said. Even though dealers can get fooled by damaged cars, too, they are more likely to refund your money. \u201cIf it\u2019s a fly-by-night and a \u2018meet me under the shade tree\u2019 deal, that money is never coming back,\u201d Scafidi said.

Jump to... Questions Background Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by Scott DiSavino, Reuters) \u2013 Hurricane Irma knocked out power to about 7.3 million homes and businesses in the U.S. Southeast, mostly in Florida, according to state officials and local electric utilities. Irma hit southwest Florida on Sunday morning as a dangerous Category 4 hurricane\u2026 It had weakened to a tropical storm by Monday morning as it headed toward Georgia. The storm, which was moving into southern Georgia, was packing maximum sustained winds of 60 miles per hour, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center\u2019s latest update at 2 p.m. EDT Monday. Power losses in Georgia, which were nearing 900,000 as of 3 p.m. EDT, were expected to increase as the storm moved north. In Florida, the state\u2019s biggest electric company said its outages dipped to 3.5 million from a peak of 3.6 million earlier on Monday. A total of almost 4.5 million Florida Power & Light (FPL)  customers have been affected by the storm, with about 1 million getting service restored, mostly by automated devices. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had that many outages, and I don\u2019t think any utility in the country ever has,\u201d FPL Chief Executive Eric Silagy  said at a news conference on Monday. \u201cIt is by far and away the largest in the history of our company.\u201d FPL said it was still assessing the damage and could not yet say when it would restore service to most customers. Some homes and businesses could be without power for weeks, especially in the hardest-hit areas like southwest Florida, the NextEra Energy Inc unit said. As the storm pushed north, outage figures were increasing at other large utilities, including units of Duke Energy Corp, Southern Co and Emera. Duke\u2019s outages held around 1.2 million on Monday afternoon, while Emera\u2019s Tampa Electric utility said outages eased to about 320,000 from a peak earlier on Monday of over 330,000. FPL said its two nuclear plants were safe. Both units at its Turkey Point facility, about 30 miles south of Miami, were shut by early Monday. The company closed Turkey Point\u2019s Unit 3 on Saturday as Irma approached the coast but decided not shut Unit 4 at that time because the hurricane track shifted away from the plant toward the western part of the Florida Peninsula. FPL shut Unit 4 on Sunday night, however, because of to a possible valve issue that was probably not related to Irma, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission officials said on Monday. At its St. Lucie nuclear plant about 120 miles north of Miami, FPL reduced power at Unit 1 because of salt buildup from Irma in the switchyard, NRC spokesman Roger Hannah said. The plant\u2019s other reactor, Unit 2, continued to operate at full power. \u2026 As Irma loomed and came ashore, gasoline stations struggled to keep up as people evacuated Florida. In the Atlanta metropolitan area, about 545 stations, or about 13.2 percent of the total, were out of the fuel earlier on Monday, according to information service Gas Buddy. Irma is expected to sap demand for fuel for a time, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note on Monday, but they cautioned that supply could remain strained because of refining capacity offline after Hurricane Harvey, which hit Texas two weeks ago.

Free Answers \u2014 Sign-up here  to receive a daily email with answers. Background What percent of Florida\u2019s electricity is generated from nuclear power? Florida was second only to Texas in 2014 in net electricity generation from natural gas, which accounted for 61%  of Florida\u2019s net generation; coal accounted for almost 23% , the state\u2019s nuclear power plants accounted for 12% , and other resources, including renewable energy, supplied the remaining electricity generation. (from floridaenergy.ufl.edu ) Florida Power & Light Company \u00a0(FPL) is the third-largest electric utility in the United States, serving nearly 5 million customer accounts or an estimated 10 million people across nearly half of the state of Florida. (The population of Florida is 20.6 million.) How we restore power FPL will begin restoring power in multiple locations and follow an overall plan that calls for restoring power to the largest number of customers safely and as quickly as possible. \u00a0We don\u2019t restore power based on when customers report an outage, where customers live or the status of accounts: We start by repairing any damage to our power plants and the power lines that carry electricity from our plants to the local substations. We prioritize restoring power to critical facilities, such as hospitals, police and fire stations, communication facilities, water treatment plants, transportation providers and shelters. At the same time, we work to return service to the largest number of customers in the shortest amount of time \u2013 including service to major thoroughfares that host supermarkets, pharmacies, gas stations and other needed community services. From here, we repair the infrastructure serving smaller groups and neighborhoods, converging on the hardest-hit areas until every customer\u2019s power is restored. Excerpted from wfmj.com Resources Prior to the arrival of Hurricane Irma, Florida Power and Light (FPL) assembled a restoration force of more than 13,500 including utility partners from 29 states: https://www.studentnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/FPL-before-the-storm.mp4 A report by the Sun Sentinel on Sunday, September 10, 2017: https://www.studentnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/south-florida-fpl-Sept10-2017.mp4 Orlando Utilities Commission (OUC) provided an update on the effort to restore power to Orlando and central Florida residents Monday afternoon: https://www.studentnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/OUC-Orlando-Utilities-Commission-Sept11-2017.mp4 Recent Daily News Articles Veterans Day 2017: Vets Plan To Boycott NFL Games On Sunday November 10, 2017 EPA approves bacteria-infected insects to kill mosquitoes November 9, 2017 Pa. officials still mostly mum on noncitizens registered to vote November 8, 2017 Tuesday\u2019s World News #1 \u2013 Lebanon November 7, 2017 US deserter Bowe Bergdahl spared prison time November 6, 2017 Get the App Follow Us Elsewhere About  \u00a0\u2014 Site Overview  \u00a0\u2014 Contact Us  \u00a0\u2014 Donate Launched in 2005, StudentNewsDaily.com is a 501(c)3 non-profit educational website.

Franklin of The Bergen Record (NJ). The picture shows three New York City firefighters raising the American flag at Ground Zero of the World Trade Center, following the September 11 attacks.  The firefighters pictured were Brooklyn-based firefighters George Johnson of Rockaway Beach, Dan McWilliams of Long Island (both from Ladder 157), and Billy Eisengrein of Staten Island (Rescue 2). The flag came from the yacht Star of America, owned by Shirley Dreifus and her late husband Spiros E. Kopelakis, of the Majestic Star, which was docked in the yacht basin in the Hudson River at the World Financial Center. McWilliams cut the yardarm off of the yacht with a K-Saw and then took the flag and its pole from the yacht to an evacuation area on the northwest side of the site. They found a pole about 20 feet off the ground. Jump to... Questions Background Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions NOTE: This article is reprinted from a September 9, 2011 Daily News Article: (by Stephanie Farr, Philly .com) \u2013 [In 2011], a decade after the 9/11 terrorist attacks at the Pentagon, New York City and Shanksville, Pa., family and friends of the fallen [visited] these consecrated spots, and the official memorials at Ground Zero and Shanksville [were] unveiled. Shanksville The 250-acre memorial in Somerset County in western Pennsylvania, which honors the victims of Flight 93, is not just a memorial. It\u2019s a cemetery. A 17-ton sandstone boulder near a mature hemlock grove at the edge of the park marks the spot where the plane hit the ground, exploding on impact. Only 8 percent of the human remains from passengers were found, and when the coroner sent cadaver dogs to sniff around the hemlock grove, the dogs just sat down, said Keith Newlin, superintendent of the memorial. \u201cSo, in other words, they\u2019re here. They\u2019re still here,\u201d Newlin said, pointing to the hemlock grove. \u201cThis is a cemetery.\u201d Because of years of construction, visitors to the site have been relegated to the park\u2019s western overlook, but on [Sept. 11, 2011], the main memorial and wall of names open[ed]. The entire park [opened] in 2017, including a new visitors center and a memorial grove of 40 trees to represent each victim. Unlike the memorials at the Pentagon and Ground Zero, which many people visit as part of planned trips to D.C. or New York, visitors to Shanksville have to make an effort to find the memorial, which is about 20 minutes from the closest highway. Perhaps that extra effort is fitting, because what sets Flight 93 apart from the others is that the passengers were not only vividly aware that they were part of a coordinated attack, they fought back and prevented the plane from reaching its intended target \u2013 reportedly the U.S. Capitol building. To Mary Duranko, 62, who came from Johnstown, Pa., to visit the memorial, the passengers of Flight 93 are more than victims. They\u2019re heroes. \u201cThey knew their destination. It was inevitable and they gave their lives,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s a big decision. I don\u2019t know if I could have made it.\u201d Before the park closed on a recent evening, as visitors started to file out, an older gentleman in an NYPD T-shirt walked away from the site with tears in his eyes. In his right hand was one of the small American flags that visitors place on the fence at the overlook in remembrance. The 69-year-old New Yorker, who preferred not to give his name, said that he lost many friends on 9/11, including his partner. He said that he worked for months at Ground Zero cleaning rubble and had made a promise to himself to \u201cbe here\u201d in Shanksville one day. \u2026.. Pentagon While men and women in Army fatigues rushed in and out of the Pentagon in Northern Virginia, all was calm at the nearby memorial. The sound of running water, so integral to the memorial\u2019s design, seemed to drown out even the traffic from nearby Route 27 and the thrumming helicopters above. Benches, made to look like airplane wings, each bear the name of a victim. They\u2019re arranged diagonally along the flight path of Flight 77, with those facing one way honoring victims on the plane and those facing the other direction commemorating people killed inside the Pentagon. Janice Tate, 66, of Madison, N.C., liked the way each individual was honored. \u201cIf it was my family member, I\u2019d very much appreciate sitting on my loved one\u2019s bench and listening to the water,\u201d she said. Brad Palmer, of Ontario, Canada, who was visiting D.C. with his wife and two boys, decided to bring them all to the memorial on his 52nd birthday. He did so, he said, because 9/11 was \u201chuge\u201d in Canada. When all air travel was grounded in the wake of the attacks, many planes were rerouted to Canada, where locals took in stranded travelers. \u201cObviously, it was specific to the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it touched people all over the world that day.\u201d Ground Zero With the finishing touches of the memorial still under way, visitors observed the progress from the second floor of the nearby World Financial Center. Matte Tonna, 43, of Parma, Italy, brought his wife and three children to see the site on their first visit to New York City. \u201cIt was something that touched the minds and souls of everybody in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would like our children to experience this, to let them see firsthand the scene of this tragedy.\u201d But just two weeks before it was to open, the site still looked like any other construction zone. \u201cWe are a little bit unimpressed,\u201d Tonna said. \u201cBut, if this is all we can see, so be it. We will come back.\u201d Nearby, Marie Livanos, 53, pointed out pending structures to her five guests from Long Island and Israel. Livanos was working at a law firm on the 40th floor of the second tower when the first plane hit the other tower. Although she would speak little of it, Livanos\u2019 guests said that she was instrumental in helping her colleagues get out alive. In 2003, Livanos\u2019 law firm moved in to the World Financial Center, where Livanos can see Ground Zero every day. \u201cAt first, when you would look out the window, you saw something that was not there,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, when you look out, you see hope. We see hope, rebuilding and future. It\u2019s like a little phoenix coming up from the ashes.\u201d One of Livanos\u2019 guests, Alon Roitman, 18, of Tel Aviv, Israel, said that terrorist attacks are a regular occurrence in his country. \u201cWho better to show us how to get through them than America?\u201d he asked. \u201cThis shows the power of democracy and the strength that comes out of rising and building ourselves up again.\u201d The Philadelphia Daily News.\u00a0 Reprinted here for educational purposes only.

Background What do you know about the first World Trade Center terrorist attack in 1993? On February 26, 1993, Islamic terrorists detonated a truck bomb below the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City. The 1,336 pound device was intended to send the North Tower (Tower 1) crashing into the South Tower (Tower 2), bringing both towers down and killing tens of thousands of people. It failed to do so but killed six people and injured more than a thousand. Watch a report from 2013, the 20th Anniversary of the first bombing of the World Trade Center: https://www.studentnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20th-Anniv-of-1993-World-Trade-Center-bombing.mp4 September 11, 2001 (9/11): The September 11 attacks \u00a0(also referred to as 9/11 )\u00a0were a series of four\u00a0suicide attacks\u00a0committed by Muslim extremists against\u00a0United States civilians\u00a0on September 11, 2001, coordinated to strike the areas of\u00a0New York City and\u00a0Washington, D.C. On that Tuesday morning, 19\u00a0terrorists\u00a0from the\u00a0Islamist\u00a0militant group\u00a0al-Qaeda\u00a0hijacked\u00a0four passenger jets. The hijackers intentionally piloted two of those planes,\u00a0American Airlines Flight 11\u00a0and\u00a0United Airlines Flight 175, into the North and South towers of the\u00a0World Trade Center\u00a0complex in New York City; both towers collapsed within two hours. The hijackers also intentionally crashed\u00a0American Airlines Flight 77\u00a0into\u00a0the Pentagon\u00a0in\u00a0Arlington, Virginia, and intended to pilot the fourth hijacked jet,\u00a0United Airlines Flight 93, into the\u00a0United States Capitol Building\u00a0in Washington, D.C.; however, the plane crashed into a field near\u00a0Shanksville, Pennsylvania\u00a0after its passengers attempted to take control of the jet from the hijackers. Nearly 3,000 people died in the attacks, including the 246 civilians and 19 hijackers aboard the four planes. Al-Qaeda and its leader Osama bin Laden cited\u00a0U.S. support of Israel, the presence of\u00a0U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, and\u00a0sanctions against Iraq\u00a0as motives for the attacks. The United States responded to the attacks by launching the\u00a0War on Terror\u00a0and\u00a0invading Afghanistan\u00a0to depose the\u00a0Taliban, which had harbored al-Qaeda. In May 2011, after years at large,\u00a0bin Laden was located and killed. (from wikipedia) Deaths: \u00a0A total of 411 emergency workers died as they tried to rescue people and fight fires The\u00a0New York City Fire Department\u00a0(FDNY) lost 340 firefighters, a chaplain and 2 paramedics. The\u00a0New York City Police Department\u00a0(NYPD) lost 23 officers. The\u00a0Port Authority Police Department\u00a0lost 37 officers. Eight emergency medical technicians (EMTs) and paramedics from private emergency medical services units were killed. At least 200 people fell or jumped to their deaths from the burning towers (as exemplified in the photograph The Falling Man ), landing on the streets and rooftops of adjacent buildings hundreds of feet below.

Questions Background Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by Richard Cowan, Roberta Rampton, Reuters) \u2013 President Donald Trump forged a surprising deal with Democrats in Congress on Wednesday to extend the U.S. debt limit [debt ceiling \u2013 see \u201cBackground\u201d below questions]  and provide government funding until Dec. 15, embracing his political adversaries and blindsiding fellow Republicans in a rare bipartisan accord. President Trump, living up to his reputation for unpredictability, met at the White House with congressional leaders from both parties and overruled Republicans and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin , who wanted a longer-term debt-limit extension rather than the three-month Democratic proposal the president embraced. \u201cWe could have done a one-year deal today,\u201d Mnuchin told reporters aboard Air Force One later in the day en route back to Washington from an event in North Dakota where Trump spoke about taxes. Mnuchin said Trump chose a short-term deal to keep his options open on possibly raising military funding later this year, suggesting a longer-term government funding deal might have blocked that. President Trump is very focused on military spending, \u201cparticularly with what\u2019s going on in North Korea and other parts of the world today,\u201d Mnuchin said. \u201cThe president wasn\u2019t willing to give up his need for additional military spending.\u201d If passed by the Republican-led Congress, the three-month agreement would avert a default on U.S. government debt, keep the government funded at the outset of the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 and provide aid to victims of Hurricane Harvey. \u201cIt was a really good moment of some bipartisanship and getting things done,\u201d top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer  said. Less than an hour before the meeting, Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan  had called the Democratic proposal that President Trump later embraced a \u201cridiculous and disgraceful\u201d idea that would \u201cplay politics with the debt ceiling.\u201d Even with the three-month extension of the debt limit, a Senate Republican aide told reporters that nothing in the tentative deal would stop the Treasury Department from using its powers to extend the deadline, depending on revenue flow. In the past, the debt limit deadline has been extended for several months under those powers. \u2026 Washington has suffered through bitter partisanship that has at times left the U.S. capital dysfunctional under Donald Trump and his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama. \u2026 The party in power, in this case Republicans, often argues for the longest debt limit increase as possible for two reasons. First, it protects members of Congress from casting multiple votes on the politically unpopular legislation over a short period of time, especially in the run-up to the 2018 congressional elections. Second, it helps stabilize markets. Even though Republicans control the White House and both chambers of Congress, [they have] yet to [pass] of any major legislation [pushed by President Trump]. \u2026 The House on Wednesday approved roughly $8 billion in initial emergency aid for relief and rebuilding after Hurricane Harvey, which tore into Texas on Aug. 25, with the measure now going to the Senate. \u201cOur No. 1 priority was getting funding for Harvey,\u201d Mnuchin said. \u201cTo get the funding for Harvey, we needed to extend the debt limit.\u201d Excerpted from the Reuters .com article by Cowan and Rampton.

Background Excerpted from an AP report by Jill Colvin at ABCNews: President Trump traveled to North Dakota yesterday after the meeting with congressional leaders at the White House in which the president sided with Democrats on a deal to fund the government and raise the federal borrowing limit [debt ceiling] for three months, all aimed at expediting money for Harvey relief. Marc Short, Trump\u2019s top legislative adviser, told reporters aboard Air Force One that \u201chelping to clear the decks in September enables us to focus on tax reform for the American people. We need to get the economy growing again and that\u2019s what the president focused on.\u201d The President used the event to talk about his tax plan, but its details are still to be determined. He said he\u2019d be getting into \u201cgreat detail\u201d on the plan in the next two weeks. Overall, it calls for a major simplification of the tax code and lowering personal rates, especially for the middle class, by raising the standard deduction, among other changes, and lowering business taxes to about 15 percent. \u201cIt\u2019s your money, not the government\u2019s money,\u201d Trump said. Trump emphasized that the last time Congress passed a major tax overhaul, under President Ronald Reagan in 1986, Democrats signed on. \u201cBoth of the Reagan tax cuts were passed by a Democratic majority in the House, a Democratic speaker, and a vast majority of Democrats in the Senate, including a Democratic senator from the great state of North Dakota,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSo it can happen. \u2026\u201d \u201cIf Democrats don\u2019t want to bring back your jobs, raise your pay and help America win \u2014 voters should deliver a clear message: Do your job to deliver for America, or find a new job,\u201d he said. WHAT IS THE DEBT CEILING? (from a 9/6 Reuters report by Amanda Becker) The \u201cdebt ceiling\u201d is a legal cap on how much money the U.S. government can borrow through bonds and other debt issued by the U.S. Treasury. It now stands at about $19.8 trillion, very close to the actual national debt. Once the ceiling is hit, Congress must raise it. If it does not, the government cannot keep borrowing. This matters because the government spends more than it collects in taxes and Washington continually borrows money to cover its bills. Legislation to raise the debt limit will need to be adopted by early October at the very latest. The Treasury, however, has said that Congress must increase the debt ceiling by Sept. 29. Since March, the Treasury has been using \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d (which it has done regularly) to stave off hitting the ceiling and likely could be stave off default a few more weeks by using such extraordinary measures, analysts have said. WHAT IF THE CEILING IS NOT RAISED? If the debt ceiling is not raised and the government can no longer pay its bills, default would result, along with a likely downgrade in the U.S. credit rating. This has never happened before, but there have been some close calls. A standoff (between President Obama and Republicans) in August 2011 cost the country its top-notch bond rating from the credit ratings agency Standard & Poors and caused the most jarring two weeks in financial markets since the 2007-2009 global financial crisis.

Questions Background Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by Max Greenwood, The Hill) \u2013 A federal appeals court in New Orleans on Tuesday gave\u00a0Texas its approval to use a revised version of the state\u2019s voter identification law  during its November election, Politico reported. A panel of the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals \u00a0in New Orleans voted 2-1 Tuesday to a lower judge\u2019s ruling, which blocked the state from enforcing a\u2026voter ID measure, known as stay Senate Bill 5 (S.B. 5) . U.S. District Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos  ruled last month that the voter identification measure\u00a0was enacted with the intent to discriminate against black and Hispanic voters. S.B. 5 was passed by the Texas legislature earlier this year in response to a court ruling that the state\u2019s original measure, Senate Bill 14 , was too restrictive and racially motivated. That law\u00a0requires\u00a0registered voters to present one of seven forms of government-issued photo ID in order to cast a ballot. S.B. 5, however, created alternatives for voters who said they could not \u201creasonably\u201d obtain one of the forms of ID outlined in the initial bill. The judges on Tuesday said that Ramos had failed to consider S.B. 5 in light of whether it fixed the problems with S.B. 14, as the 5th Circuit had ordered in an earlier ruling. \u201cThe State has made a strong showing that it is likely to succeed on the merits. S.B. 5 allows voters without qualifying photo ID to cast regular ballots by executing a declaration that they face a reasonable impediment to obtaining qualifying photo ID,\u201d Judges Jerry Smith  and Jennifer Elrod  wrote on Tuesday in the joint order provided by Politico. \u201cThe State has made a strong showing that this reasonable-impediment procedure remedies plaintiffs\u2019 alleged harm and thus forecloses plaintiffs\u2019 injunctive relief.\u201d Reprinted here for educational purposes only.

Explain your answer. b) Republicans say voter identification is necessary to prevent voter fraud. They present statistics showing that people who are deceased have voted, that people with fake names vote, that people vote in two different locations and that in various locations, more people vote than are eligible to vote in that district. (See \u201cBackground\u201d below) Democrats say identification should not be required to vote because it causes voter disenfranchisement (voter suppression). In other words, Democrats say that requiring a citizen to show identification when voting unfairly prevents minorities from voting as they are unable to obtain a valid identification and/or will be intimidated into not voting. They say that requiring citizens to show proof of identity prohibits people who don\u2019t have a driver\u2019s license, passport, or other photo ID, from voting.

Background \u201cAt least 3.5 million more  people are on U.S. election rolls than are eligible to vote. Under federal law, the 1993 National Voter Registration Act and the 2002 Help America Vote Act require states to maintain accurate voter lists. Nonetheless, some state politicians ignore this law. Others go further: Governor Terry McAuliffe (D., Va.) vetoed a measure last February that would have mandated investigations of elections in which ballots cast outnumbered eligible voters. \u2026and when Florida\u2019s GOP governor Rick Scott tried to obey these laws and update Florida\u2019s records, including deleting 51,308 deceased voters, then-President Obama\u2019s Justice Department filed a federal lawsuit to stop him. Federal prosecutors claimed that Governor Scott\u2019s statewide efforts violated the 1965 Voting Rights Act, although it applies to only five of Florida\u2019s 67 counties. The Election Integrity Project of Judicial Watch \u2014 a Washington-based legal-watchdog group \u2014 analyzed data from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s 2011\u20132015 American Community Survey and July\u2019s statistics from the federal Election Assistance Commission. The latter included figures provided by 38 states. My tabulation of Judicial Watch\u2019s state-by-state results yielded 462 counties where the registration rate exceeded 100 percent. There were 3,551,760 more people registered to vote than adult U.S. citizens who inhabit these counties.\u201d \u00a0(Aug. 11, 2017 by Deroy Murdock at NR) From VoteTexas.Gov \u2013 Acceptable forms of photo ID: Texas driver license issued by the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) Texas Election Identification Certificate issued by DPS Texas personal identification card issued by DPS Texas license to carry a handgun issued by DPS United States military identification card containing the person\u2019s photograph United States citizenship certificate containing the person\u2019s photograph United States passport With the exception of the U.S. citizenship certificate, the identification must be current or have expired no more than 4 years before being presented for voter qualification at the polling place.

SECURITY COUNCIL: (read more at the website un.org/Docs/sc/unsc_background.html ) The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) is\u00a0charged with the maintenance of international peace and security. Its powers, outlined in the United Nations Charter, include the establishment of peacekeeping operations, the establishment of international sanctions, and the authorization of military action. Its powers are exercised through United Nations Security Council Resolutions. There are 15 members of the Security Council, consisting of five veto-wielding permanent members (China, France, Russia, United Kingdom, United States) and ten elected members with two-year terms [these are not eligible for immediate re-election] Security Council members must always be present at UN headquarters in New York so that the Security Council can meet at any time. Each Council member has one vote. Decisions on substantive matters (including imposing sanctions on a country) require nine votes, including the concurring votes of all five permanent members. Under the UN Charter, all 191 Member States (countries) of the United Nations agree to accept and carry out the decisions of the Security Council.\u00a0 While other organs of the United Nations make recommendations to Governments, the Council alone has the power to make decisions which Member States are obligated under the Charter to carry out. About the Defense Department: The Department of Defense \u00a0(the Pentagon) is the Executive Department of the U.S. government charged with coordinating and supervising all agencies and functions of the government concerned directly with national security and the U.S. armed forces. The Department \u2013 headed by the\u00a0Secretary of Defense\u00a0\u2013 has three subordinate military departments: the\u00a0U.S. Department of the Army, the\u00a0U.S. Department of the Navy, and the\u00a0U.S. Department of the Air Force\u00a0which oversee the\u00a0U.S. Army,U.S. Navy,\u00a0U.S. Marine Corps, and the\u00a0U.S. Air Force.

The Secretary of Defense \u00a0(currently James Mattis) is in the\u00a0chain of command\u00a0and exercises\u00a0command and control, subject only to the orders of the President, over all Department of Defense forces (the\u00a0Army,\u00a0Navy,\u00a0Air Force, and\u00a0Marine Corps) for both operational and administrative purposes. Because the Office of Secretary of Defense is vested with legal powers which exceeds those of any\u00a0commissioned officer, and is second only to the President in the military hierarchy, it has sometimes unofficially been referred to as a de facto \u00a0\u201ddeputy\u00a0commander-in-chief.\u201d The\u00a0Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff\u00a0is the principal military adviser to the Secretary of Defense and the President, and while the Chairman may assist the Secretary and President in their command functions, the Chairman is not in the chain of command. The Secretary of Defense,\u00a0Secretary of State, the\u00a0Attorney General\u00a0and the\u00a0Secretary of the Treasury, are generally regarded as the four most important cabinet officials because of the importance of their departments.

Gen. William C. Doyle Veterans Memorial Cemetery in honor of Memorial Day Friday, May 22, 2015, in Wrightstown, N.J. Jump to... Questions Background Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions The following is from USMemorialDay.org : Memorial Day started off as a somber day of remembrance; a day when Americans went to cemeteries and placed flags or flowers on the graves of our war dead. It was a day to remember ancestors, family members, and loved ones who gave the ultimate sacrifice. But now, too many people \u201ccelebrate\u201d the day without more than a casual thought to the purpose and meaning of the day. How do we honor the 1.8 million that gave their life for America since 1775? How do we thank them for their sacrifice? We believe Memorial Day is one day to remember. We can do so by: visiting cemeteries and placing flags or flowers on the graves of our fallen heroes visiting memorials flying the U.S. Flag at half-staff until noon flying the \u2018POW/MIA Flag\u2019 as well (Section 1082 of the 1998 Defense Authorization Act) participating in a \u201c National Moment of Remembrance \u201d at 3 p.m. to pause and think upon the true meaning of the day, and for Taps to be played renewing a pledge to aid the widows, widowers, and orphans of our fallen dead, and to aid the disabled veterans USMemorialDay .org has received many emails from people expressing their thanks for those who have served and gave the ultimate sacrifice for this country. The following, received in 1999 and used with the author\u2019s permission, sums up all the emails USMemorialDay .org has received very elegantly, and is true to the original spirit and meaning of Memorial Day: This weekend I am going to do something different. I am going to buy some carnations each day and go to one of the nearby cemeteries and walk through the sections for soldiers. When I find a grave that has no flowers, I\u2019ll leave one and say a prayer for the family of that person, who for some reason could not bring their soldier flowers. I will pray for our country and all who serve or have served. For their families, who also serve by losing precious days, weeks and months spent with their loved ones who are off serving, preserving peace and the freedom we have in this country. I\u2019ll pray for the families who paid the ultimate price, who\u2019s loved ones died, or were taken captive and never returned. I\u2019ll pray for anyone who may still be held in captivity and thinks perhaps they are forgotten. I do NOT forget. I\u2019ll say a prayer for every person on the Internet who takes a moment from their time to come to sites like yours and be reminded of what this holiday really means. And I\u2019ll say a prayer of thanks and ask God\u2019s richest blessings on you. Thank you again\u2026. and God bless! Sylvia Mohr Families brave the rain and visit the graves of their U.S. serviceman and women on Memorial Day at the Houston National Cemetery, Monday, May 26, 2014, in Houston. In fact, wonderful people in other nations sometimes show more of the true spirit and mission of the U.S. Memorial Day than we do here. For example, a 2001 USMemorialDay .org Guestbook entry from a citizen of the Netherlands states: Hi, In 1999 I laid flowers at the grave of a young U.S. fighter pilot who was KIA in my village in 1945. In the Netherlands I know of schools \u2018adopting\u2019 graves of Allied servicemen, keeping those graves in excellent condition ! Does anybody know of adopting graves in the U.S. by schools? Sincerely, Paul Patist\u00a0Castricum, The Netherlands \u2013 Tue May 15, 2001. More schools in the U.S. could follow the lead of the Netherland schools.

Background FACTS ABOUT MEMORIAL DAY: Originally called Decoration Day, from the early tradition of decorating graves with flowers, wreaths and flags, Memorial Day is a day for remembrance of those who have died in service to our country. Memorial Day was officially proclaimed on May 5, 1868 by General John Logan, national commander of the Grand Army of the Republic. Memorial Day was first observed on May 30, 1868 when a special ceremony was held at the Arlington National Cemetery where flowers were placed on the graves of Union and Confederate soldiers. Memorial Day was originally known as \u201cDecoration Day.\u201d The alternative name \u201cMemorial Day\u201d was first used in 1882. Moina Michael conceived of the idea to wear red poppies on Memorial day in honor of those who died serving the nation during war. She was the first to wear one, and sold poppies to her friends and co-workers with the money going to benefit servicemen in need.\u00a0 In 1921, her efforts resulted in the poppy being adopted as a symbol of remembrance for war veterans by the American Legion Auxiliary. Memorial Day is usually observed in the United States on the last Monday of May. Memorial Day was first enacted to honor Union soldiers of the American Civil War, but its scope was expanded after World War I to include all U.S. men and women who died while in the military service. The National Memorial Day Concert takes place on the west lawn of the United States Capitol and is broadcasted every year on and NPR. PBS Waterloo, NY was given an official recognition as the birthplace of Memorial Day  on May 26, 1966, when President Lyndon B. Johnson signed a proclamation declaring the same. The National Moment of Remembrance , established by Congress in 2000, asks Americans, wherever they are at 3 p.m., local time, on Memorial Day, to pause in an act of national unity for a duration of one minute. The time 3 p.m. was chosen because it is the time when most Americans are enjoying their freedoms on the national holiday. The Moment does not replace traditional Memorial Day events; rather, it is an act of national unity in which all Americans, alone or with family and friends, honor those who died in service to the United States. (At this time,\u00a0NASCAR has its drivers pull over mid-race. Major-league baseball pauses its games, and Amtrak trains blow their whistles.) The idea for the Moment was born when children touring the Nation\u2019s Capital were asked by the Commission\u2019s Director what Memorial Day means. They responded, \u201cThat\u2019s the day the pool opens.\u201d Resources Read about Memorial Day at memorialdayfoundation.org \u00a0and usmemorialday.org .

Read the history of Taps at: west-point.org/taps/Taps.html While there are no official lyrics for Taps, the following unofficial verse (author unknown) is often used: Fading light dims the sight, And a star gems the sky, gleaming bright.

Scarce heard amid the guns below. We are the dead. Short days ago We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow Loved, and were loved, and now we lie In Flanders fields. Take up our quarrel with the foe: To you from failing hands we throw The torch; be yours to hold it high. If ye break faith with us who die We shall not sleep, though poppies grow In Flanders fields.

(by Romeo Ranoco, Reuters and Raul Dancel, StraitsTimes) PANTAR, Philippines \u2014\u00a0Thousands of Filipino civilians fled fighting on Wednesday as troops tried to fend off Islamist militants who took over large parts of Marawi city, capturing Christians, seizing and torching buildings and setting free scores of prisoners. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the rampage. The terrorist attacks\u00a0on Tuesday in Marawi in\u00a0the southern Philippine island of Mindanao\u00a0 forced President Rodrigo Duterte  to impose martial law  across the island, which is\u00a0home to some 20 million Filipinos. About a hundred extremists from the Maute group mounted attacks across Marawi, a mainly Muslim city in the southern island of Mindanao\u00a0 on Tuesday, after after a botched raid by security forces on a hideout of the Maute, a militant Islamist group that has pledged allegiance to Islamic State .\u00a0The operation was aimed at capturing Isnilon Hapilon, a leader of the Abu Sayyaf group  notorious for piracy, banditry and for kidnapping and decapitating Westerners. Abu Sayyaf is a Jihadist militant group  that follows the Wahhabi doctrine of Sunni Islam based in and around Jolo and Basilan islands in the southwestern part of the Philippines. It\u00a0is one of the smallest and most violent jihadist groups in the southern Philippines. Hapilon  was\u00a0designated by ISIS last year as its top man in Southeast Asia. He is designated a terrorist by the US State Department, which has a bounty of up to $5 million for his arrest.\u00a0Security analysts say Hapilon has been trying to unite groups in the Philippines that have professed allegiance to ISIS. These include the Islamist terrorist , which is based near Marawi. Maute group After the failed attempt to capture Hapilon, more than 100 Islamic fighters quickly dispersed, torching buildings and taking over bridges, a hospital, two jails, a church and a college. Soldiers and guerrillas set up rival checkpoints and roadblocks on routes in and around Marawi as civilians fled the city of 200,000 in droves, leaving behind what one official described as a ghost town. Long lines\u00a0of pickup trucks and jeeps crammed full of people and loaded with belongings crawled along roads into nearby towns as troops searched vehicles for weapons and bombs. The military said it had rescued 120 people from a school and a hospital and was trying to isolate Maute fighters while awaiting reinforcements that were being blocked by rebels. Maute snipers and booby traps were hampering operations, which the army said could last three more days. The Catholic church said militants were using Christians and a priest as human shields and had contacted cardinals with threats to execute hostages unless government troops withdrew. Thirteen militants and seven security personnel have so far been killed and 33 troops wounded, the army said. Mujiv Hataman, governor of the Autonomous Region in Mindanao, said the terrorists freed 107 prisoners from the local prison, among them Maute rebels. Duterte said martial law would mean checkpoints and arrests and searches without warrant, and it would go on for as long as necessary \u2013 that\u00a0Islamic State must be repelled from the Christian-majority Philippines and he would use all means possible to crush the Maute group and the allied Abu Sayyaf. \u201cAnyone now holding a gun, confronting government with violence, my orders are spare no one, let us solve the problems of Mindanao once and for all,\u201d said Duterte, who is from the island, after cutting short a visit to Russia and returning to Manila. \u201cIf I think you should die, you will die. If you fight us, you will die. If there\u2019s an open defiance, you will die, and if it means many people dying, so be it. That\u2019s how it is.\u201d \u201cI made a projection, not a prediction, that one of these days the hardest things to deal with would be the arrival of ISIS,\u201d Duterte said, referring to Islamic State.\u00a0\u201cThe government must put an end to this. I cannot gamble with ISIS because they are everywhere.\u201d Duterte said he would not tolerate abuses of power by security forces under martial law, but critics said the military rule in all of Mindanao, an island the size of South Korea with a population of 22 million, was an overreaction. Referring to Senior Inspector Freddie Solar, the police officer who had been murdered\u00a0by the terrorists,\u00a0President Duterte said, \u201cThings like this the government cannot allow\u2026 Government must put an end to this\u2026 I will not allow the country to go to the dogs.\u201d Compiled and adapted from news reports at Reuters  and StraitsTimes .

Background Did you know? Islamist militancy is not new to the southern Philippines, where a decades-long Muslim separatist insurgency has claimed more than 120,000 lives. Muslim rebels orchestrated a siege in the southern city of Zamboanga in 2013 that left more than 200 people dead. What happens under martial law? Martial law allows the president to \u2018call out the armed forces to prevent or suppress lawless violence, invasion or rebellion\u2019, according to the Philippines constitution. Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said security forces would be able to arrest suspected militants and hold them for three days without charge. (from UK Daily Mail) The following is a paragraph from the provision in the Philippines Constitution of 1987 about the declaration of martial law: Art. VII, Sec. 18.  \u2013 The President shall be the Commander-in-Chief of all armed forces of the Philippines and whenever it becomes necessary, he may call out such armed forces to prevent or suppress lawless violence, invasion or rebellion. In case of invasion or rebellion, when the public safety requires it, he may, for a period not exceeding sixty days, suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus or place the Philippines or any part thereof under martial law. \u2026 Resources Read: Statement of the AFP Western Mindanao Command  on the Marawi incident . # PrayForMarawi Watch two news reports: https://www.studentnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ISIS-crisis-in-Philippines-Duterte-declares-martial-law_RT.mp4 https://www.studentnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ISIS-Linked-Gunmen-Storm-Philippine-City_One-News-Page.mp4 Recent Daily News Articles Veterans Day 2017: Vets Plan To Boycott NFL Games On Sunday November 10, 2017 EPA approves bacteria-infected insects to kill mosquitoes November 9, 2017 Pa. officials still mostly mum on noncitizens registered to vote November 8, 2017 Tuesday\u2019s World News #1 \u2013 Lebanon November 7, 2017 US deserter Bowe Bergdahl spared prison time November 6, 2017 Get the App Follow Us Elsewhere About  \u00a0\u2014 Site Overview  \u00a0\u2014 Contact Us  \u00a0\u2014 Donate Launched in 2005, StudentNewsDaily.com is a 501(c)3 non-profit educational website.

All civilized nations much be united in this effort. \u00a0This trip is focused on that goal: \u00a0bringing nations together around the goal of defeating the terrorism that threatens the world, and crushing the hateful ideology that drives it so hard and seems to be driving it so fast. It is a privilege to stand here in this national museum, in the ancient city of Jerusalem, to address the Israeli people and all people in the Middle East who yearn for security, prosperity and peace. Jerusalem is a sacred city. \u00a0Its beauty, splendor, and heritage are like no other place on Earth. \u00a0What a heritage. \u00a0What a heritage. \u00a0The ties of the Jewish people to this Holy Land are ancient and eternal. \u00a0They date back thousands of years, including the reign of King David whose star now flies proudly on Israel\u2019s white and blue flag. Yesterday, I visited the Western Wall, and marveled at the monument to God\u2019s presence and man\u2019s perseverance. \u00a0I was humbled to place my hand upon the wall and to pray in that holy space for wisdom from God. \u00a0I also visited and prayed at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, a site revered by Christians throughout the world. \u00a0I laid a wreath at Yad Vashem, honoring, remembering, and mourning the six million Jews who were murdered in the Holocaust. \u00a0I pledged right then and there what I pledge again today: \u00a0the words \u201cnever again.\u201d Israel is a testament to the unbreakable spirit of the Jewish people. \u00a0From all parts of this great country, one message resounds, and that is the message of hope. \u00a0Down through the ages, the Jewish people have suffered persecution, oppression, and even those who have sought their destruction. \u00a0But, through it all, they have endured and, in fact, they have thrived. \u00a0I stand in awe of the accomplishments of the Jewish people, and I make this promise to you: \u00a0My administration will always stand with Israel. \u00a0Thank you very much. Through your hardships, you have created one of the most abundant lands anywhere in the world \u2014 a land that is rich not only in history, culture, and opportunity, but especially in spirit. \u00a0This museum where we are gathered today tells the story of that spirit. \u00a0From the two Holy Temples, to the glorious heights of Masada, we see an incredible story of faith and perseverance. \u00a0That faith is what inspired Jews to believe in their destiny, to overcome their despair, and to build here \u2014 right here \u2014 a future that others dared not even to dream. In Israel, not only are Jews free to till the soil, teach their children, and pray to God in the ancient land of their fathers \u2014 and they love this land, and they love God \u2014 but Muslims, Christians, and people of all faiths are free to live and worship according to their conscience, and to follow their dreams, right here. Today, gathered with friends, I call upon all people \u2014 Jews, Christians, Muslims, and every faith, every tribe, every creed \u2014 to draw inspiration from this ancient city, to set aside our sectarian differences, to overcome oppression and hatred, and to give all children the freedom and hope and dignity written into our souls. Earlier this week, I spoke at a very historic summit in Saudi Arabia. \u00a0I was hosted by King Salman \u2014 a very wise man. \u00a0There, I urged our friends in the Muslim world to join us in creating stability, safety and security. \u00a0And I was deeply encouraged by the desire of many leaders to join us in cooperation toward these shared and vital goals. Conflict cannot continue forever. \u00a0The only question is when nations will decide that they have had enough \u2014 enough bloodshed, enough killing. \u00a0That historic summit represents a new opportunity for people throughout the Middle East to overcome sectarian and religious divisions, to extinguish the fires of extremism, and to find common ground and shared responsibility in making the future of this region so much better than it is right now. Change must come from within. \u00a0 It can only come from within. \u00a0No mother or father wants their children to grow up in a world where terrorists roam free, schoolchildren are murdered, and their loved ones are taken. \u00a0No child is born with prejudice in their heart. \u00a0No one should teach young boys and girls to hate and to kill. \u00a0No civilized nation can tolerate the massacre of innocents with chemical weapons. My message to that summit was the same message I have for you: \u00a0We must build a coalition of partners who share the aim of stamping out extremists and violence, and providing our children a peaceful and hopeful future. \u00a0But a hopeful future for children in the Middle East requires the world to fully recognize the vital role of the State of Israel. \u00a0 And, on behalf of the United States, we pledge to stand by you and defend our shared values so that together we can defeat terrorism and create safety for all of God\u2019s children. Israelis have experienced firsthand the hatred and terror of radical violence. \u00a0Israelis are murdered by terrorists wielding knives and bombs. \u00a0Hamas and Hezbollah launch rockets into Israeli communities where schoolchildren have to be trained to hear the sirens and run to the bomb shelters \u2014 with fear, but with speed. \u00a0ISIS targets Jewish neighborhoods, synagogues, and storefronts. \u00a0And Iran\u2019s leaders routinely call for Israel\u2019s destruction. \u00a0Not with Donald J. Trump, believe me. \u00a0(Applause.) \u00a0Thank you. \u00a0I like you too. \u00a0(Laughter.) Despite these challenges, Israel is thriving as a sovereign nation, and no international body should question the contributions Israel makes to the region and, indeed, the world. \u00a0Today, let us pray for that peace and for a more hopeful future across the Middle East. There are those who present a false choice. \u00a0They say that we must choose between supporting Israel and supporting Arab and Muslim nations in the region. \u00a0That is completely wrong. \u00a0All decent people want to live in peace, and all humanity is threatened by the evils of terrorism. \u00a0Diverse nations can unite around the goal of protecting innocent life, upholding human dignity, and promoting peace and stability in the region. My administration is committed to pursuing such a coalition, and we have already made substantial progress during this trip. \u00a0We know, for instance, that both Israelis and Palestinians seek lives of hope for their children. \u00a0And we know that peace is possible if we put aside the pain and disagreements of the past and commit together to finally resolving this crisis, which has dragged on for nearly half a century or more. As I have repeatedly said, I am personally committed to helping Israelis and Palestinians achieve a peace agreement, and I had a meeting this morning with President Abbas and can tell you that the Palestinians are ready to reach for peace. \u00a0I know you\u2019ve heard it before. \u00a0I am telling you \u2014 that\u2019s what I do. \u00a0They are ready to reach for peace. In my meeting with my very good friend, Benjamin, I can tell you also that he is reaching for peace. \u00a0He wants peace. \u00a0He loves people. \u00a0He especially loves the Israeli people. \u00a0Benjamin Netanyahu wants peace. Making peace, however, will not be easy. \u00a0We all know that. \u00a0Both sides will face tough decisions. \u00a0But with determination, compromise, and the belief that peace is possible, Israelis and Palestinians can make a deal. But even as we work toward peace, we will build strength to defend our nations. \u00a0The United States is firmly committed to keep Iran from developing a nuclear weapon and halting their support of terrorists and militias. \u00a0(Applause.) \u00a0So we are telling you right now that Iran will not have nuclear weapons. America\u2019s security partnership with Israel is stronger than ever. \u00a0Under my administration, you see the difference \u2014 big, big beautiful difference \u2014 (laughter and applause) \u2014 including the Iron Dome missile defense program, which has been keeping the Israeli people safe from short-range rockets launched by Hezbollah and Hamas, and David\u2019s Sling, which guards against long range missiles. \u00a0It is my hope that someday, very soon, Israeli children will never need to rush towards shelters again as sirens ring out loud and clear. Finally, the United States is proud that Israeli Air Force pilots are flying the incredible, new American F-35 planes. \u00a0There is nothing in the world like them to defend their nation, and it was wonderful to see these mighty aircraft in the skies over Israel recently as you celebrated the 69th anniversary of Israel\u2019s independence. But even as we strengthen our partnership in practice, let us always remember our highest ideals. \u00a0Let us never forget that the bond between our two nations is woven together in the hearts of our people, and their love of freedom, hope, and dignity for every man and every woman. \u00a0Let us dream of a future where Jewish, Muslim, and Christian children can grow up together and live together in trust, harmony, tolerance, and respect. The values that are practiced in Israel have inspired millions and millions of people all across the world. \u00a0The conviction of Theodor Herzl rings true today: \u00a0\u201cWhatever we attempt there for our own benefit will rebound mightily and beneficially to the good of all mankind.\u201d As we stand in Jerusalem, we see pilgrims of all faiths coming to this land to walk on this hallowed ground. \u00a0Jews place the prayers from their hearts in the stone blocks of the beautiful Western Wall. \u00a0Christians pray in the pews of an ancient church. \u00a0Muslims answer the call to prayer at their holy sites. \u00a0This city, like no other place in the world, reveals the longing of human hearts to know and to worship God. Jerusalem stands as a reminder that life can flourish against any odds. \u00a0When we look around this city \u2014 so beautiful \u2014 and we see people of all faiths engaged in reverent worship, and schoolchildren learning side-by-side, and men and women lifting up the needy and forgotten, we see that God\u2019s promise of healing has brought goodness to so many lives. \u00a0We see that the people of this land had the courage to overcome the oppression and injustice of the past and to live in the freedom God intends for every person on this Earth. Today, in Jerusalem, we pray and we hope that children around the world will be able to live without fear, to dream without limits, and to prosper without violence. \u00a0I ask this land of promise to join me to fight our common enemies, to pursue our shared values, and to protect the dignity of every child of God. Thank you. \u00a0God bless you. \u00a0God bless the State of Israel. \u00a0And God bless the United States. \u00a0Thank you very much.

Daily News Article  \u00a0\u00a0\u2014\u00a0\u00a0  Posted on May 23, 2017 Erdogan bodyguards brutally attack anti-Erdogan protesters in Washington DC Jump to... Questions Background Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by Chuck Ross, The Daily Caller) \u2013 Bodyguards working for Turkey\u2019s authoritarian president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan , were involved in a massive brawl that left nine people injured outside of the residence of Turkey\u2019s ambassador in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday, May 16. The melee, which was caught on video, occurred just after President Erdogan met with President Trump at the White House. Protesters critical of the Turkish government claimed that Erdogan\u2019s bodyguards or security staffers working for the Turkish embassy launched the attack. Video of the fight showed men in suits kicking people, including women, some while they were on the ground. The footage shows some victims covered in blood. Aram Suren Hamparian , the president of the Armenian National Committee of America, filmed some of the incident and says he believes that the instigators were Erdogan bodyguards or security personnel working for the Turkish ambassador. \u201cThey just literally broke through the [police] line, crossed the street, and stopped the protesters [by attacking them],\u201d Hamparian told The Daily Caller by phone (See map of Turkish Embassy and location of protestors ) Hamparian, who is highly critical of Erdogan,\u00a0said that two dozen anti-Erdogan protesters, mostly Armenian and Kurdish, were protesting peacefully across the street from the residence. He said that the onslaught broke out suddenly.\u00a0He says the videos show that the pro-Erdogan fighters appeared to be professionals of some sort. He also said they outnumbered the protesters. \u201cIt all took place at once. It was by very capable people.\u00a0It felt to me, it looked to me like a highly orchestrated attack,\u201d he added. Hamparian said that some Erdogan supporters were not violent. He said that he spent most of the night at the hospital with some victims of the attack. One man who Hamparian helped received between 10 and 15 stitches, he said. Another woman underwent a CT scan. Halil Mutlu, a cousin of President Erdogan\u2019s  and a board member of the Turkish American Steering Committee, was spotted on the sidelines of the fray. At one point he was seen leading a pro-Erdogan chant aimed at the government critics. Tuesday\u2019s brawl harkens back to Erdogan\u2019s visit to Washington, D.C. in March 2016. During a visit to the Brookings Institution, Erdogan\u2019s bodyguards verbally and physically assaulted a group of protesters. Washington, D.C. police appeared to struggle to contain the incident. According to The Guardian, two arrests were made. [Specifically, two protesters were arrested. No bodyguards who attacked the protesters were arrested.] After the battle subsided, Erdogan appeared outside of the ambassador\u2019s residence to speak with supporters. [Later news reports state that President Erdogan was outside the embassy before the brawl and it is possible (it appears) that the bodyguards took orders from President Erdogan to attack the peaceful Kurdish-American and Armenian-American protesters.] [From UK Guardian and Daily Telegraph reports: \u201cAll of the sudden they just ran towards us,\u201d Yazidi Kurd demonstrator Lucy Usoyan told ABC, adding that she was attacked by a pro-Erdo\u011fan supporter. \u201cSomeone was beating me in the head nonstop, and I thought, \u2018Okay, I\u2019m on the ground already, what is the purpose to beat me?\u2019\u201d Tensions between Mr. Erdogan\u2019s government and the Kurdish minority in the country are high. Erdogan met with Trump\u00a0amid disagreements over Washington\u2019s decision to arm the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia that Ankara regards as an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). \u00a0Washington does not agree. The PKK has fought an insurgency in southeastern Turkey since 1984 and is considered a terrorist group by the United States, Turkey and Europe. A ceasefire between Turkey and the PKK ended last year and clashes have since claimed hundreds of lives on both sides. Mr Erdogan\u2019s government has been carrying out a broad crackdown on political opponents, including among the Kurds, in the aftermath of a failed coup attempt in July, arresting or firing\u00a0tens of thousands of people (including teachers and other professionals) from their jobs.] Reprinted here for educational purposes only.

Police Department made adequate preparation for Erdogan\u2019s visit last week? Explain your answer. 6. Watch the videos under \u201cResources\u201d below.

Background Following the attack by President Erdogan\u2019s bodyguards, the Turkish governemnt is demanding an apology from the U.S. According to Turkish pro-government media, which includes all mainstream newspapers and TV channels in Turkey, the video and U.S. news\u00a0got the story wrong. In the Turkish state media version, \u201cterrorist sympathizers and Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK) supporters\u201d had started to create trouble. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s bodyguards decided to intervene, they say, because US police were not able to adequately handle that situation. Resources Watch a video of the attack: https://www.studentnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Turkish-president-bodyguards-attack-protesters-in-DC.mp4 President Erdogan does not tolerate any opposition. Turkish-born NBA player Enes Kanter had his passport revoked by Turkey this week when he was traveling abroad. Kanter, who plays center for the Oklahoma City Thunder, has long been an outspoken critic of Turkey\u2019s President Erdogan. He says Turkey canceled his passport in retaliation for his political views. \u00a0Watch an interview: https://www.studentnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Turkish-NBA-player-says-Erdogan-is-a-dictator.mp4 Recent Daily News Articles Veterans Day 2017: Vets Plan To Boycott NFL Games On Sunday November 10, 2017 EPA approves bacteria-infected insects to kill mosquitoes November 9, 2017 Pa. officials still mostly mum on noncitizens registered to vote November 8, 2017 Tuesday\u2019s World News #1 \u2013 Lebanon November 7, 2017 US deserter Bowe Bergdahl spared prison time November 6, 2017 Get the App Follow Us Elsewhere About  \u00a0\u2014 Site Overview  \u00a0\u2014 Contact Us  \u00a0\u2014 Donate Launched in 2005, StudentNewsDaily.com is a 501(c)3 non-profit educational website.

Jump to... Questions Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions President Trump is on a 9 day trip to Saudi Arabia, Israel, the Vatican and Brussels. He traveled to Riyadh on Saturday and Sunday spoke to 55 leaders from Muslim-majority countries. In place of a news report on the speech, read the President\u2019s actual speech and answer the questions. TEXT OF FULL SPEECH: President Donald Trump address in Saudi Arabia on May 21, 2017: I want to thank King Salman for his extraordinary words, and the magnificent Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for hosting today\u2019s summit. I am honored to be received by such gracious hosts. I have always heard about the splendor of your country and the kindness of your citizens, but words do not do justice to the grandeur of this remarkable place and the incredible hospitality you have shown us from the moment we arrived. You also hosted me in the treasured home of King Abdulaziz, the founder of the Kingdom who united your great people. Working alongside another beloved leader\u2014American President Franklin Roosevelt\u2014King Abdulaziz began the enduring partnership between our two countries. King Salman: your father would be so proud to see that you are continuing his legacy\u2014and just as he opened the first chapter in our partnership, today we begin a new chapter that will bring lasting benefits to our citizens. Let me now also extend my deep and heartfelt gratitude to each and every one of the distinguished heads of state who made this journey here today. You greatly honor us with your presence, and I send the warmest regards from my country to yours. I know that our time together will bring many blessings to both your people and mine. I stand before you as a representative of the American People, to deliver a message of friendship and hope. That is why I chose to make my first foreign visit a trip to the heart of the Muslim world, to the nation that serves as custodian of the two holiest sites in the Islamic Faith. In my inaugural address to the American People, I pledged to strengthen America\u2019s oldest friendships, and to build new partnerships in pursuit of peace. I also promised that America will not seek to impose our way of life on others, but to outstretch our hands in the spirit of cooperation and trust. Our vision is one of peace, security, and prosperity\u2014in this region, and in the world. Our goal is a coalition of nations who share the aim of stamping out extremism and providing our children a hopeful future that does honor to God. President Donald Trump delivers a speech to the Arab Islamic American Summit, May 21, 2017, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. And so this historic and unprecedented gathering of leaders\u2014unique in the history of nations\u2014is a symbol to the world of our shared resolve and our mutual respect. To the leaders and citizens of every country assembled here today, I want you to know that the United States is eager to form closer bonds of friendship, security, culture and commerce. For Americans, this is an exciting time. A new spirit of optimism is sweeping our country: in just a few months, we have created almost a million new jobs, added over 3 trillion dollars of new value, lifted the burdens on American industry, and made record investments in our military that will protect the safety of our people and enhance the security of our wonderful friends and allies\u2014many of whom are here today. Now, there is even more blessed news I am pleased to share with you. My meetings with King Salman, the Crown Prince, and the Deputy Crown Prince, have been filled with great warmth, good will, and tremendous cooperation. Yesterday, we signed historic agreements with the Kingdom that will invest almost $400 billion in our two countries and create many thousands of jobs in America and Saudi Arabia. This landmark agreement includes the announcement of a $110 billion Saudi-funded defense purchase\u2014and we will be sure to help our Saudi friends to get a good deal from our great American defense companies. This agreement will help the Saudi military to take a greater role in security operations. We have also started discussions with many of the countries present today on strengthening partnerships, and forming new ones, to advance security and stability across the Middle East and beyond. Later today, we will make history again with the opening of a new Global Center for Combating Extremist Ideology\u2014located right here, in this central part of the Islamic World. This groundbreaking new center represents a clear declaration that Muslim-majority countries must take the lead in combatting radicalization, and I want to express our gratitude to King Salman for this strong demonstration of leadership. I have had the pleasure of welcoming several of the leaders present today to the White House, and I look forward to working with all of you. President Donald Trump delivers a speech to the Arab Islamic American Summit, May 21, 2017, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. America is a sovereign nation and our first priority is always the safety and security of our citizens. We are not here to lecture\u2014we are not here to tell other people how to live, what to do, who to be, or how to worship. Instead, we are here to offer partnership\u2014based on shared interests and values\u2014to pursue a better future for us all. Here at this summit we will discuss many interests we share together. But above all we must be united in pursuing the one goal that transcends every other consideration. That goal is to meet history\u2019s great test\u2014to conquer extremism and vanquish the forces of terrorism. Young Muslim boys and girls should be able to grow up free from fear, safe from violence, and innocent of hatred. And young Muslim men and women should have the chance to build a new era of prosperity for themselves and their peoples. With God\u2019s help, this summit will mark the beginning of the end for those who practice terror and spread its vile creed. At the same time, we pray this special gathering may someday be remembered as the beginning of peace in the Middle East\u2014and maybe, even all over the world. But this future can only be achieved through defeating terrorism and the ideology that drives it. Few nations have been spared its violent reach. America has suffered repeated barbaric attacks\u2014from the atrocities of September 11th to the devastation of the Boston Bombing, to the horrible killings in San Bernardino and Orlando. The nations of Europe have also endured unspeakable horror. So too have the nations of Africa and even South America. India, Russia, China and Australia have been victims. But, in sheer numbers, the deadliest toll has been exacted on the innocent people of Arab, Muslim and Middle Eastern nations. They have borne the brunt of the killings and the worst of the destruction in this wave of fanatical violence. Some estimates hold that more than 95 percent of the victims of terrorism are themselves Muslim. We now face a humanitarian and security disaster in this region that is spreading across the planet. It is a tragedy of epic proportions. No description of the suffering and depravity can begin to capture its full measure. The true toll of ISIS, Al Qaeda, Hezbollah, Hamas, and so many others, must be counted not only in the number of dead. It must also be counted in generations of vanished dreams. The Middle East is rich with natural beauty, vibrant cultures, and massive amounts of historic treasures. It should increasingly become one of the great global centers of commerce and opportunity. This region should not be a place from which refugees flee, but to which newcomers flock. Saudi Arabia is home to the holiest sites in one of the world\u2019s great faiths. Each year millions of Muslims come from around the world to Saudi Arabia to take part in the Hajj. In addition to ancient wonders, this country is also home to modern ones\u2014including soaring achievements in architecture. Egypt was a thriving center of learning and achievement thousands of years before other parts of the world. The wonders of Giza, Luxor and Alexandria are proud monuments to that ancient heritage. All over the world, people dream of walking through the ruins of Petra in Jordan. Iraq was the cradle of civilization and is a land of natural beauty. And the United Arab Emirates has reached incredible heights with glass and steel, and turned earth and water into spectacular works of art. The entire region is at the center of the key shipping lanes of the Suez Canal, the Red Sea, and the Straits of Hormuz. The potential of this region has never been greater. 65 percent of its population is under the age of 30. Like all young men and women, they seek great futures to build, great national projects to join, and a place for their families to call home. But this untapped potential, this tremendous cause for optimism, is held at bay by bloodshed and terror. There can be no coexistence with this violence. There can be no tolerating it, no accepting it, no excusing it, and no ignoring it. Every time a terrorist murders an innocent person, and falsely invokes the name of God, it should be an insult to every person of faith. Terrorists do not worship God, they worship death. If we do not act against this organized terror, then we know what will happen. Terrorism\u2019s devastation of life will continue to spread. Peaceful societies will become engulfed by violence. And the futures of many generations will be sadly squandered. If we do not stand in uniform condemnation of this killing\u2014then not only will we be judged by our people, not only will we be judged by history, but we will be judged by God. This is not a battle between different faiths, different sects, or different civilizations. This is a battle between barbaric criminals who seek to obliterate human life, and decent people of all religions who seek to protect it. This is a battle between Good and Evil. When we see the scenes of destruction in the wake of terror, we see no signs that those murdered were Jewish or Christian, Shia or Sunni. When we look upon the streams of innocent blood soaked into the ancient ground, we cannot see the faith or sect or tribe of the victims\u2014we see only that they were Children of God whose deaths are an insult to all that is holy. But we can only overcome this evil if the forces of good are united and strong\u2014and if everyone in this room does their fair share and fulfills their part of the burden. Terrorism has spread across the world. But the path to peace begins right here, on this ancient soil, in this sacred land. America is prepared to stand with you\u2014in pursuit of shared interests and common security. But the nations of the Middle East cannot wait for American power to crush this enemy for them. The nations of the Middle East will have to decide what kind of future they want for themselves, for their countries, and for their children. It is a choice between two futures\u2014and it is a choice America CANNOT make for you. A better future is only possible if your nations drive out the terrorists and extremists. Drive. Them. Out. DRIVE THEM OUT of your places of worship. DRIVE THEM OUT of your communities. DRIVE THEM OUT of your holy land, and DRIVE THEM OUT OF THIS EARTH. For our part, America is committed to adjusting our strategies to meet evolving threats and new facts. We will discard those strategies that have not worked\u2014and will apply new approaches informed by experience and judgment. We are adopting a Principled Realism, rooted in common values and shared interests. Our friends will never question our support, and our enemies will never doubt our determination. Our partnerships will advance security through stability, not through radical disruption. We will make decisions based on real-world outcomes \u2013 not inflexible ideology. We will be guided by the lessons of experience, not the confines of rigid thinking. And, wherever possible, we will seek gradual reforms \u2013 not sudden intervention. We must seek partners, not perfection\u2014and to make allies of all who share our goals. Above all, America seeks peace\u2014not war. Muslim nations must be willing to take on the burden, if we are going to defeat terrorism and send its wicked ideology into oblivion. The first task in this joint effort is for your nations to deny all territory to the foot soldiers of evil. Every country in the region has an absolute duty to ensure that terrorists find no sanctuary on their soil. Many are already making significant contributions to regional security: Jordanian pilots are crucial partners against ISIS in Syria and Iraq. Saudi Arabia and a regional coalition have taken strong action against Houthi militants in Yemen. The Lebanese Army is hunting ISIS operatives who try to infiltrate their territory. Emirati troops are supporting our Afghan partners. In Mosul, American troops are supporting Kurds, Sunnis and Shias fighting together for their homeland. Qatar, which hosts the U.S. Central Command, is a crucial strategic partner. Our longstanding partnership with Kuwait and Bahrain continue to enhance security in the region. And courageous Afghan soldiers are making tremendous sacrifices in the fight against the Taliban, and others, in the fight for their country. As we deny terrorist organizations control of territory and populations, we must also strip them of their access to funds. We must cut off the financial channels that let ISIS sell oil, let extremists pay their fighters, and help terrorists smuggle their reinforcements. I am proud to announce that the nations here today will be signing an agreement to prevent the financing of terrorism, called the Terrorist Financing Targeting Center \u2013 co-chaired by the United States and Saudi Arabia, and joined by every member of the Gulf Cooperation Council. It is another historic step in a day that will be long remembered. I also applaud the Gulf Cooperation Council for blocking funders from using their countries as a financial base for terror, and designating Hezbollah as a terrorist organization last year. Saudi Arabia also joined us this week in placing sanctions on one of the most senior leaders of Hezbollah. Of course, there is still much work to do. That means honestly confronting the crisis of Islamist extremism and the Islamist terror groups it inspires. And it means standing together against the murder of innocent Muslims, the oppression of women, the persecution of Jews, and the slaughter of Christians. Religious leaders must make this absolutely clear: Barbarism will deliver you no glory \u2013 piety to evil will bring you no dignity. If you choose the path of terror, your life will be empty, your life will be brief, and YOUR SOUL WILL BE CONDEMNED. And political leaders must speak out to affirm the same idea: heroes don\u2019t kill innocents; they save them. Many nations here today have taken important steps to raise up that message. Saudi Arabia\u2019s Vision for 2030 is an important and encouraging statement of tolerance, respect, empowering women, and economic development. The United Arab Emirates has also engaged in the battle for hearts and souls\u2014and with the U.S., launched a center to counter the online spread of hate. Bahrain too is working to undermine recruitment and radicalism. I also applaud Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon for their role in hosting refugees. The surge of migrants and refugees leaving the Middle East depletes the human capital needed to build stable societies and economies. Instead of depriving this region of so much human potential, Middle Eastern countries can give young people hope for a brighter future in their home nations and regions. That means promoting the aspirations and dreams of all citizens who seek a better life\u2014including women, children, and followers of all faiths. Numerous Arab and Islamic scholars have eloquently argued that protecting equality strengthens Arab and Muslim communities. For many centuries the Middle East has been home to Christians, Muslims and Jews living side-by-side. We must practice tolerance and respect for each other once again\u2014and make this region a place where every man and woman, no matter their faith or ethnicity, can enjoy a life of dignity and hope. In that spirit, after concluding my visit in Riyadh, I will travel to Jerusalem and Bethlehem, and then to the Vatican\u2014visiting many of the holiest places in the three Abrahamic Faiths. If these three faiths can join together in cooperation, then peace in this world is possible \u2013 including peace between Israelis and Palestinians. I will be meeting with both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Starving terrorists of their territory, their funding, and the false allure of their craven ideology, will be the basis for defeating them. But no discussion of stamping out this threat would be complete without mentioning the government that gives terrorists all three\u2014safe harbor, financial backing, and the social standing needed for recruitment. It is a regime that is responsible for so much instability in the region. I am speaking of course of Iran. From Lebanon to Iraq to Yemen, Iran funds, arms, and trains terrorists, militias, and other extremist groups that spread destruction and chaos across the region. For decades, Iran has fueled the fires of sectarian conflict and terror. It is a government that speaks openly of mass murder, vowing the destruction of Israel, death to America, and ruin for many leaders and nations in this room. Among Iran\u2019s most tragic and destabilizing interventions have been in Syria. Bolstered by Iran, Assad has committed unspeakable crimes, and the United States has taken firm action in response to the use of banned chemical weapons by the Assad Regime\u2014launching 59 tomahawk missiles at the Syrian air base from where that murderous attack originated. Responsible nations must work together to end the humanitarian crisis in Syria, eradicate ISIS, and restore stability to the region. The Iranian regime\u2019s longest-suffering victims are its own people. Iran has a rich history and culture, but the people of Iran have endured hardship and despair under their leaders\u2019 reckless pursuit of conflict and terror. Until the Iranian regime is willing to be a partner for peace, all nations of conscience must work together to isolate Iran, deny it funding for terrorism, and pray for the day when the Iranian people have the just and righteous government they deserve. The decisions we make will affect countless lives. King Salman, I thank you for the creation of this great moment in history, and for your massive investment in America, its industry and its jobs. I also thank you for investing in the future of this part of the world. This fertile region has all the ingredients for extraordinary success \u2013 a rich history and culture, a young and vibrant people, a thriving spirit of enterprise. But you can only unlock this future if the citizens of the Middle East are freed from extremism, terror and violence. We in this room are the leaders of our peoples. They look to us for answers, and for action. And when we look back at their faces, behind every pair of eyes is a soul that yearns for justice. Today, billions of faces are now looking at us, waiting for us to act on the great question of our time. Will we be indifferent in the presence of evil? Will we protect our citizens from its violent ideology? Will we let its venom spread through our societies? Will we let it destroy the most holy sites on earth? If we do not confront this deadly terror, we know what the future will bring\u2014more suffering and despair. But if we act\u2014if we leave this magnificent room unified and determined to do what it takes to destroy the terror that threatens the world\u2014then there is no limit to the great future our citizens will have. The birthplace of civilization is waiting to begin a new renaissance. Just imagine what tomorrow could bring. Glorious wonders of science, art, medicine and commerce to inspire humankind. Great cities built on the ruins of shattered towns. New jobs and industries that will lift up millions of people. Parents who no longer worry for their children, families who no longer mourn for their loved ones, and the faithful who finally worship without fear. These are the blessings of prosperity and peace. These are the desires that burn with a righteous flame in every human heart. And these are the just demands of our beloved peoples. I ask you to join me, to join together, to work together, and to FIGHT together\u2014BECAUSE UNITED, WE WILL NOT FAIL. Thank you. God Bless You. God Bless Your Countries. And God Bless the United States of America. Questions PLEASE NOTE: Daily posting and \u201cAnswers\u201d emails will end for the school year on Friday, May 26th. 1.

Green arrested the two men \u2013 Buckle and 24-year-old Cortez Collins. He then followed protocol by putting on gloves and a mask to search the car, Wright told WKBN.

Background Fentanyl , previously used only as a pharmaceutical painkiller for crippling pain at the end of life or for surgical procedures, fentanyl is now making headlines as the drug responsible for a growing proportion of overdose deaths, including that of pop star Prince. So what is fentanyl and why is it so dangerous? Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid, meaning it is made in a laboratory but acts on the same receptors in the brain that painkillers, like oxycodone or morphine, and heroin, do. Fentanyl, however, is far more powerful. It\u2019s 50-100 times stronger than heroin or morphine, meaning even a small dosage can be deadly. Its potency also means that it is profitable for dealers as well as dangerous for those who use it, intentionally or unintentionally. Increasingly heroin is being mixed with fentanyl so someone who uses what they think is heroin may in fact be getting a mixture with \u2014 or even pure \u2014 fentanyl. More recently, pills made to look like the painkiller oxycodone or the anxiety medication Xanax are actually fentanyl. This deception is proving fatal. It would be like ordering a glass of wine and instead getting a lethal dose of pure ethanol. While many people don\u2019t know they are getting fentanyl, others might unfortunately seek it out as part of the way the brain disease of addiction manifests itself into compulsively seeking the next powerful high. Every single episode of fentanyl use carries the risk of immediate death.

(by Katie Lobosco, CNN Money) \u2013 Lawmakers approved legislation Wednesday that will expand the that launched in 2014. It made tuition and fees free for recent high school graduates enrolled in a community college or technical school. Now, adults who don\u2019t already have an associate\u2019s or bachelor\u2019s degree can go for free, too, starting in the 2018 fall semester. Tennessee Promise program [Republican] Governor Bill Haslam  is expected to sign the bill into law. He proposed the legislation in his State of the State address earlier this year. It\u2019s a cornerstone of his initiative to increase the number of residents with a college education to 55% by 2025. Last year, less than 39% of residents had gone to college. \u201cIf we want to have jobs ready for Tennesseans, we have to make sure that Tennesseans are ready for jobs, and there is no smarter investment than increasing access to high-quality education,\u201d Haslam said in a statement. To be eligible, students must have been a state resident for at least a year before applying, maintain a 2.0 GPA, enroll in enough classes to be a part-time student, and complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Expanding the free-tuition program will cost about $11.2 million once fully implemented. But it will be funded by the state\u2019s lottery account, just like the rest of Tennessee Promise. [An estimated 20,000 are expected to enroll in the first year, said Mike Krause, executive director of the Tennessee Higher Education Commission.] Students will save about $3,700 a year, which is the average cost of tuition and fees at Tennessee\u2019s 13 community colleges. If they already receive a need-based Pell Grant from the federal government, Tennessee will cover any remaining cost. Should states be in the gambling business? Since Haslam, a Republican, pushed for the Tennessee Promise program in 2014, the idea of tuition-free college has gained some traction. Oregon has made community college free for recent high school grads and GED recipients, too. San Francisco will make community college free for all residents starting this fall. In April, New York made tuition free at two- and four-year colleges for students whose families earn no more than $125,000 a year. Lawmakers in Rhode Island are also considering a proposal to make two years of college tuition-free. More than 33,000 students have benefited from the in its first two years, raising enrollment among first-time freshmen by 30%, according to the governor\u2019s office.

In lotteries, the poor are the biggest losers (excerpted from a CNN report by David R. Just, Dec. 18, 2013) \u2026 Most of those who play [the lottery] know they have little chance of winning anything. Ever. And most of them probably can\u2019t afford to play, anyway. Still, they line up to place their dollars on the counter, all for a snowball\u2019s chance at an instant miracle, even as that miracle has gotten harder to attain. Lotteries and games of chance such as the Mega Millions, or more traditional casinos, have come in vogue among politicians seeking to raise revenues without raising taxes. This seems like a net win all around \u2014 players receive the entertainment of playing and we all enjoy the benefits of higher funding for schools or other public works. Unfortunately the reality is not so rosy. Those in poverty or near poverty not only are more likely to play the lottery than those with greater means, they also spend a larger percent of their money on average on these games of chance. \u2026 there are big jumps in lottery purchases when the poverty rate increases, when unemployment increases, or when people enroll on welfare. Lottery playing among the poor is a Hail Mary investment strategy \u2014 a small ray of hope. But this false hope is, by design, an attempt to lure the emotional decision-maker. Recent changes in the Mega Millions lottery have reduced the chances of winning in order to increase the size of the jackpot. By changing the range of the six possible numbers drawn \u2014 from between 1 and 56 to between 1 and 75 \u2014 the already improbable odds of 1 in 176 million have diminished to a virtually impossible 1 in 259 million. Fewer big winners means larger jackpots, more hype and more players. And more money for the lotteries. Such changes have occurred as the lottery commissions have become expert in swindling players out of their money. Humans aren\u2019t particularly good at dealing with risks and gambles. We tend to believe that rare events are more common than they truly are. Moreover, we don\u2019t discern between small changes in very low probabilities. Thus, few will have noticed that the odds of winning the lottery reduced from 0.000000006 to 0.000000004 for any given ticket. But our eyes are drawn to the steadily increasing prizes\u2014prizes that are now designed to eventually exceed $1 billion. Such astronomical amounts draw in even those who consider themselves very prudent. When the prizes get this large, many start to rationalize the purchase of a ticket. In the end, there are few who win money, and many who simply lose a few dollars with nothing to show for it. But those few dollars add up.

Questions Background Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (Compiled from reports by Jamiel Lynch and Debra Goldschmidt for CNN and from CBS News) \u2013 Too much caffeine caused the death of a 16-year-old high school sophomore\u00a0from South Carolina who collapsed during class last month, according to the county coroner. Davis Allen Cripe  died from a caffeine-induced cardiac event causing a probable arrhythmia , Richland County Coroner Gary Watts  announced in a news conference Monday. During an arrhythmia, or abnormal heart rhythm, the heart may not be able to pump enough blood to the body, and lack of blood flow affects the brain, heart and other organs. The teen consumed three caffeine-laden drinks \u2014 a cafe latte, large Diet Mountain Dew and an energy drink \u2014 in a two-hour period before collapsing in his classroom at Spring Hill High School on April 26, Watts said.\u00a0A classmate who was with Davis the day he died, said he loaded up on caffeine \u2014 and \u201cbasically chugged\u201d an energy drink during class. Among those at the news conference Monday was the teen\u2019s father, Sean Cripe . \u201cHe was a great kid, he didn\u2019t get mixed up in the wrong things \u2014 he loved music,\u201d Mr.\u00a0Cripe said. \u201cLike all parents, we worry about our kids as they grow up. We worry about their safety, their health, especially once they start driving. But it wasn\u2019t a car crash that took his life. Instead, it was an energy drink.\u201d Watts said Davis had purchased the latte at McDonald\u2019s around 12:30 p.m. After that he consumed the Diet Mountain Dew and the energy drink. Davis collapsed at the school in Chapin, near Columbia, just before 2:30 p.m. and according to Watts, was pronounced dead at 3:40 p.m.\u00a0Davis had an abnormal reaction to the caffeine, Watts said: \u201cYou can have five people line up and all of them do the exact same thing with him that day, drink more, and it may not have any type of effect on them at all. \u00a0These drinks, this amount of caffeine, how it\u2019s ingested can have dire consequences and that\u2019s what happened in this case, \u201d Watts said. \u201cYou know it when it happens. You start to feel dizzy. You can feel it in your chest,\u201d said CBS News medical contributor Dr. David Agus . Agus says energy drinks send more than 20,000 people to the emergency room annually. \u201cThe problem that we\u2019re learning is that it\u2019s not just caffeine, it\u2019s the other stimulants that are in there.\u00a0 In a cup of coffee, you may [drink it]\u00a0over 45 minutes or 60 minutes. These energy drinks you\u2019re [drinking]\u00a0all at once. And so all the caffeine give this big peak in the body and that\u2019s when bad things happen.\u201d Agus said. Davis\u2019 autopsy showed no undiagnosed heart conditions and that Davis was healthy and had no conditions that could have been triggered by the caffeine intake. Also, no other drugs or alcohol were found in the teen\u2019s system, according to Watts. \u201cThis was not an overdose. We lost Davis from a totally legal substance,\u201d Watts said. \u201cOur purpose here today is to let people know, especially our young kids in school, that these drinks can be dangerous, and be very careful with how you use them, and how many you drink on a daily basis.\u201d Mr.\u00a0Cripe said he hopes that if nothing else comes out of this, parents and kids will realize the dangers of caffeinated beverages. \u201cParents, please talk to your kids about the dangers of these energy drinks,\u201d he said. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that adolescents, age 12 to 18, should not consume more than 100 milligrams of caffeine per day. The AAP also\u00a0says energy drinks usually contain additives not tested on children and advises against children and teens drinking energy drinks of any kind. The American Beverage Association, which represents the makers of almost all energy drinks sold in America, did not return a request for comment. The trade group says their energy drinks can be safely consumed in moderation. CNN\u2019s Jacqueline Howard and Jen Christensen contributed to this report.

(by Associated Press at New York Daily News) BEIJING \u2014 China is tightening rules for online news as censors  try to control a flood of information spread through instant-messaging apps, blogs and other media sources that are proliferating  across the country. The rules announced May 2nd will require online publishers to obtain government licenses and block foreign or private companies from investing in online news services or directly disseminating  news. Chinese news outlets will have to undergo a security review before working with foreign companies, according to a statement from the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) , [China\u2019s internet regulator], which take effect June 1. The move follows a crackdown on dissent  under Communist Party leader President Xi Jinping  that has led to tighter controls on what can be published online. China\u2019s President Xi Jinping is the current General Secretary of the Communist Party and Chairman of the Central Military Commission. With the latest rules, the government will require internet companies to censor what their customers see or risk losing their right to distribute news, Chinese media expert Qiao Mu  said. \u201cThis is aimed at the companies rather than the individual users,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not only to ideologically control information, but also to control the source of the information.\u201d There are more than 700 million internet users in China. Authorities have long sought to block material considered subversive  by erasing objectionable items off news sites and microblogs. \u2026[China is notorious for its tight grip on online content. It put in place a censorship firewall , commonly known as the , which blocks popular sites such as Google, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Wikipedia, leaving Chinese internet users only with Chinese duplicates of the services such as Baidu and Weibo. The mainland is also set to release its version of Wikipedia in 2018. Today, the country ranks fifth from the bottom on the World Press Freedom Index, as compiled by Reporters without Borders.] Great Firewall Many internet users in China regularly circumvent (find a way around) \u00a0that system by using virtual private networks, or VPNs . Those offer encrypted connections intended to thwart censorship and allow access to banned sites. The new rules adopt a more proactive  approach, placing\u00a0restrictions on news site ownership and funding \u2013 and targeting companies or individuals that violate them. News services will face penalties such as criminal prosecution if they fail to \u201cpersist in \u2026 serving socialism,\u201d promote a \u201c benign  online culture,\u201d and \u201csafeguard the national interest.\u201d Qiao said three of China\u2019s biggest internet companies \u2014 \u2014 could be affected. Each provides access to news: Baidu via its popular search platform, Tencent through the WeChat messaging app and NetEase through its Mobile News app. Baidu, Tencent, and NetEase Numerous smaller news providers that use the larger companies\u2019 platforms also would fall under the new rules, Qiao said. \u2026 The rules target Chinese internet services and seem unlikely to affect foreign news organizations and websites based overseas, many of which are already blocked in China. How much information gets filtered out will be determined by how forcefully agencies including the Cybersecurity Administration enforce the new rules, said Zhan Jiang with the Department of International Journalism and Communication at Beijing Foreign Studies University . The official Communist government\u2019s characterized the rules as a security measure intended in part to protect the privacy of users. \u2026 Xinhua News Agency Reprinted here for educational purposes only from an Associated Press story.

Questions Background Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by Lorne Cook and John Leicester, Associated Press at ABCNews) BRUSSELS \u2013\u00a0The U.S. is expected to broaden its ban on in-flight laptops and tablets to include planes from the European Union, a move that would create logistical chaos on the world\u2019s busiest corridor of air travel. \u2026European governments held urgent talks on Friday with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The ban would affect trans-Atlantic routes that carry as many as 65 million people a year on over 400 daily flights, many of them business travelers who rely on their electronics to work during the flight. The ban would dwarf in size the current one, which was put in place in March and affects about 50 flights per day from 10 cities, mostly in the Middle East. Chief among the concerns are whether any new threat prompted the proposal and the relative safety of keeping in the cargo area a large number of electronics with lithium batteries, which have been known to catch fire. American officials were invited to Brussels next week to discuss the proposed ban, the EU said. \u2026 \u2026The decision in March to bar laptops and tablets from the cabins of some international flights \u2026[followed intelligence reports that terrorist groups are continuing to plot attacks against commercial aviation, U.S. officials said at the time.] Experts say a bomb in the cabin would be easier to make and require less explosive force than one in the cargo hold. Baggage in cargo usually goes through a more sophisticated screening process than carry-on bags. Jeffrey Price , an aviation-security expert at Metropolitan State University of Denver, said the original ban focused on certain countries because their equipment to screen carry-on bags is not as effective as machines in the U.S. Whatever the disruption new restrictions cause, passengers may just have to adjust, U.S. Travel Association spokesman Jonathan Grella said. (AP Photo) A French official  who was briefed about Friday\u2019s meeting said the Americans announced they wanted to extend the ban, and the Europeans planned to formulate a response in coming days. The official said the primary questions revolved around when and how \u2014 and not whether \u2014 the ban would be imposed. The official spoke only on condition of anonymity to discuss the plan. Jenny Burke , a Homeland Security spokeswoman, said no final decision has been made on expanding the restriction. But Homeland Security officials met Thursday with high-ranking executives of the three leading U.S. airlines \u2014 American, Delta and United \u2014 and the industry\u2019s leading U.S. trade group, Airlines for America, to discuss expanding the laptop policy to flights arriving from Europe. Two airline officials  who were briefed on the discussions said Homeland Security gave no timetable for an announcement, but they were resigned to its inevitability. They spoke only on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the meeting publicly. The U.S. airlines still hope to have a say in how the policy is put into effect at airports to minimize inconvenience to passengers.\u00a0\u2026 Alain Bauer , president of the CNAPS, a French regulator of private-sector security agents, including those checking baggage and passengers in France\u2019s airports, predicted \u201cchaotic\u201d scenes initially if the ban was instituted. \u201cImagine the number of people who carry their laptops and tablets onto planes \u2014 not just adults, but also children,\u201d he told the AP. He said it would slow passage through security checks as people try to negotiate a way of keeping their laptops. \u2026 \u201cYou need a lot of time to inform them and a lot of time for it to enter people\u2019s heads until it becomes a habit,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter a week of quite big difficulties, 95 percent of people will understand the practicalities.\u201d \u2026..\u00a0[Whatever the disruption new restrictions cause, passengers may just have to adjust, U.S. Travel Association spokesman Jonathan Grella  said Thursday. Travelers are \u201cmore resilient than we often think \u2014 plus the consequences of a major attack on the transportation system hardly need to be repeated,\u201d Grella said.] (Leicester reported from Paris.

What was the initial reason for the laptop ban on certain flights in March? 2. How many flights/ people could potentially be affected by a new ban? 3. What are the two biggest concerns about this new ban on flights ARRIVING FROM Europe? 4. People have questioned why DHS is not concerned that terrorists would still put bombs in laptops, asking \u2013 wouldn\u2019t they still do the same damage if the laptop bombs are placed in the checked luggage? How do experts address this question? 5. Obviously, a ban on laptops and tablets will be extremely inconvenient for travelers \u2013 businesspeople trying to work during a flight, parents trying to keep their kids occupied, etc. Re-read paragraphs 15-20. Then watch the videos under \u201cResources\u201d below the questions. Politico reports: \u201cSome luxury airlines affected by the initial ban found ways to lessen the inconvenience: UAE\u2019s Emirates Air said it would offer a \u2018laptop and tablet handling service\u2019 that would \u2018carefully\u2019 pack the passengers\u2019 devices and return them at the destination, while the UAE\u2019s Etihad Air provided loaner iPads to customers in first and business classes. But such perks are unlikely for the vast majority of U.S. passengers.\u201d DHS is working to avoid a potential terrorist attack on an airliner to the best of their ability. There is a possibility that laptops and tablets could sometime be banned on flights in the U.S. a) List some solutions U.S. airlines and airports could use to lessen the inconvenience to passengers. b) What could technology companies do to address the loss of laptops/tablets during flights? 6. Have you heard the phrases \u201cAmerican ingenuity\u201d or \u201cAmerican ingenuity and know-how\u201d? Ingenuity  is defined as: the ability to solve problems in new and clever ways. Wikipedia describes \u201cYankee ingenuity\u201d: Yankee ingenuity is: inventiveness, technical solutions to practical problems, \u201cknow-how,\u201d self-reliance and individual enterprise associated with the Yankees, who originated in New England and developed much of the industrial revolution in the United States after 1800. The [term] first appeared in the 19th century. Yankee ingenuity characterizes an attitude of make-do with materials on hand. It is inventive improvisation, adaptation and overcoming of shortages of materials. The term was common worldwide in the wake of World War II, as American forces employed engineering solutions to military problems. Today it refers broadly to a typically American pragmatic approach to problem solving instead of traditional methods. a) Do you believe Americans still have this kind of \u201cingenuity and know-how\u201d to solve the problems that will be caused by a laptop ban on U.S. airlines?

Questions Background Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (from FoxNews with Associated Press) \u2013 Texas Gov. Greg Abbott  signed a bill Sunday prohibiting the state\u2019s cities and counties from enacting so-called \u201csanctuary\u201d laws that prevent local law enforcement officers from inquiring about the immigration status of anyone they detain . Abbott [broadcast the]\u00a0signing of the bill on Facebook with no advanced public notice. He said Texas residents expect lawmakers to \u201ckeep us safe\u201d and said similar laws have already been tested in federal court, where opponents have already been hinting the bill will be immediately challenged. \u201cLet\u2019s face it, the reason why so many people come to America is because we are a nation of laws and Texas is doing its part to keep it that way,\u201d Abbott said. The timing of the signing caught Democratic lawmakers by surprise. Democratic state Rep. Cesar Blanco  said it looked like Abbott \u201cwanted to get ahead\u201d of any protests surrounding the bill signing. Abbott spokesman John Wittman  said they chose to sign the bill on a Facebook livestream because that\u2019s \u201cwhere most people are getting their news nowadays.\u201d \u2026 Teri Burke, executive director of the ACLU of Texas , said \u201cwe will fight this assault in the court\u201d and the ballot box. Abbott said key provisions of the bill had already been tested at the U.S. Supreme Court, which struck down several components of Arizona\u2019s sanctuary city law but allowed the provision permitting police to ask about immigration status. Republicans say the bill is needed to ensure local jails [comply with]\u00a0requests from federal officials to keep dangerous offenders behind bars. The bill allows police to inquire about the immigration status of anyone they detain, a situation that can range from arrest for a crime to being stopped for a traffic violation. It also requires local officials to comply with federal requests to hold criminal suspects for possible deportation. One of the bill\u2019s most controversial   [The new measure would fine government entities up to $25,500 for each day the law is violated.\u00a0It would also result in a misdemeanor charge for sheriffs, police chiefs and constables who fail to comply with detention requests and in removal from office for elected and appointed officials, Abbott\u2019s office said. provisions  allows for criminal charges against city or county officials who intentionally refuse to comply  with federal authorities\u2019 attempt to deport people in the country illegally who already have been jailed on offenses unrelated to immigration. Elected officials could face up to a year in jail and lose their posts if convicted of official misconduct. \u201cAs Governor, my top priority is public safety, and this bill furthers that objective by keeping dangerous criminals off our streets,\u201d Abbott said in a press release. \u201cIt\u2019s inexcusable to release individuals from jail that have been charged with heinous crimes like sexual assault against minors, domestic violence and robbery.\u201d] Opponents blasted the Texas bill as a version of Arizona\u2019s immigration crackdown law, SB 1070, which launched protests, lawsuits and national controversy in 2010. The Arizona law went to the U.S. Supreme court, which voided much of the measure but allowed the provision permitting police to ask [a person stopped] about immigration status. But the Texas and Arizona bills are not identical. Whereas the Arizona law required police to try to determine the immigration status of people during routine stops, the Texas bill doesn\u2019t instruct officers to ask. But it does allow Texas police to inquire whether a person is in the country legally, even if they\u2019re not under arrest. Every major police chief in Texas opposed the bill. Thomas Saenz, president of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, said millions in the nation\u2019s second most populous state will now be subjected to racial profiling and suggested that worried Hispanic residents will now be less willing to cooperate with police investigations. \u2026 Texas doesn\u2019t currently have any cities which have formally declared themselves sanctuaries for immigrants. But   [When signing the bill, Governor Abbott explained: Sally Hernandez, the sheriff of Travis County , which includes liberal Austin, angered\u00a0conservatives by refusing to honor federal detainer requests if the suspects weren\u2019t arrested for immigration offenses or serious crimes such as murder. Hernandez softened her policy after Abbott cut funding to the county, saying decisions would be made on a case-by-case basis. She has said she will conform to the state\u2019s ban if it becomes law. \u201cWe all support legal immigration. It helped to build America and Texas. Texas strongly supports the legal immigration that has been a part of our state from the very beginning.\u00a0But, legal immigration is different from harboring people who have committed dangerous crimes. This law cracks down on policies like (those of) the Travis County Sheriff, who declared that she would not detain known criminals accused of violent crimes. Those policies are sanctuary city policies and won\u2019t be tolerated in Texas. Elected officials and law enforcing agencies, they don\u2019t get to pick and choose which laws the obey. There are consequences, deadly consequences, to not enforcing the law.\u201d The Associated Press contributed to this report. Reprinted here for educational purposes only.

CHALLENGE QUESTION: The Hill reported in February that an overwhelming majority of Americans believe that cities that arrest illegal immigrants for crimes should be required to turn them over to federal authorities. The poll shows that President Trump has broad public support in his effort to crack down on sanctuary cities. A survey from Harvard\u2013Harris Poll found that 80 percent of voters said local authorities should have to comply with the law by reporting to federal agents the illegal immigrants they come into contact with. As it stands, hundreds of cities across the nation \u2014 many with Democratic mayors or city councils \u2014 are refusing to do so. Do an internet search for \u201cTX governor signs bill banning sanctuary cities.\u201d Watch several news reports on this event. Are the reports critical of the Governor\u2019s position and supportive/sympathetic to immigrants who are not here legally? Do the reports clarify that this law is aimed at illegal immigrants who have committed crimes? Are the reports accurate and unbiased? Do the reports provide comments equally from people who support and oppose the bill? Free Answers \u2014 Sign-up here  to receive a daily email with answers. Background The Hill reported  on Tuesday (Feb 21, 2017) that an overwhelming majority of Americans believe that cities that arrest illegal immigrants for crimes should be required to turn them over to federal authorities. The poll shows that President Trump has broad public support in his effort to crack down on sanctuary cities. A survey from Harvard\u2013Harris Poll provided exclusively to The Hill found that by reporting to federal agents the illegal immigrants they come into contact with. 80 percent of voters say local authorities should have to comply with the law As it stands, hundreds of cities across the nation \u2014 many with Democratic mayors or city councils \u2014 are refusing to do so. Trump has signed an executive order directing Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly to find ways to withhold federal funding from these sanctuary cities until they enforce the law. A\u00a0Reuters analysis\u00a0found the top 10 sanctuary cities in the U.S. receive $2.27 billion in federal funding for programs ranging from public health services to early childhood education. Many of these mayors would rather risk losing their federal funding for these programs than enforce federal immigration law. One exception is Miami-Dade, which is the first locality to reverse its status as a sanctuary city: Miami-Dade formally dropped its status as a \u201csanctuary\u201d for illegal immigrants on Febuary 17 after the county commissioners voted 9-3 to uphold an order from Miami Mayor Carlos Gimenez \u00a0that local authorities cooperate with federal immigration officials, in accordance with the law, and refuse to provide arrested illegal immigrants sanctuary. Gimenez defended the decision, pointing out most of the immigrants affected are prior offenders, and that local authorities would not be actively seeking out and detaining illegal immigrants.\u00a0\u201cLook. I am an immigrant myself,\u201d he said. \u201cI can assure our residents that I will not comply with any executive order that will unfairly put our law-abiding immigrants at risk.\u201d The poll also revealed that 75% of voters favor increasing border patrol, while only 47% favor a wall [we do not know how the question was worded, as The Hill chose not to provide that information. It is believed that the disparity indicates what has been publicized in previous polls: that most\u00a0people prefer various ways to secure the border, but\u00a0say it does not need to be a physical wall].

Jump to... Questions Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (Compiled from articles by Andrew Griffin at the UK Independent and by Jay Bennett at Popular Mechanics) \u2013 The US Air Force has landed its experimental unmanned plane in Florida, bringing to an end a two-year mission that is a complete secret. X-37B The plane \u2014 which can fly itself and looks like a small space shuttle \u2014 landed over the weekend at Cape Canaveral, bringing to an end a flight that began in May 2015. But the US Air Force didn\u2019t reveal what it had been doing in the air or why it had come back down. The X-37B, one of two in the Air Force fleet, conducted unspecified experiments for 718 days while in orbit. It was the fourth and lengthiest mission so far for the secretive program, managed by the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office . What exactly the Air Force uses the X-37B for is classified . The orbiters \u201cperform risk reduction, experimentation and concept-of-operations development for reusable space vehicle technologies,\u201d the Air Force has said without providing details. The cost of the program is also classified. The vehicles are 29 feet\u00a0long and have a wingspan of 15 feet, making them about one quarter of the size of the NASA\u2019\u0080\u0099s now-retired space shuttles. The X-37B, also known as Orbital Test Vehicle, or OTV , first flew in April 2010 and returned after eight months. A second mission launched in March 2011 and lasted 15 months, while a third took flight in December 2012 and returned after 22 months. It has been widely speculated that the craft is used for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions, spying on operations in places like Iran and North Korea. Because the craft can land and have its payload swapped out whenever the Air Force deems it necessary, the X-37B could potentially be used for a number of missions and testing platforms. Experts have also guessed that the X-37B could be used for testing autonomous flight technologies, serve as a communications relay in orbit, or serve as a testing platform for systems that could ultimately be used on a manned spacecraft. The operations of the X-37B might be classified, but there is no hiding it when it reenters the atmosphere and shakes the countryside with a sonic boom. This is the first time the craft has landed in Florida, having performed all three of its previous landings at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. \u00a0The Air Force relocated the program in 2014, taking over two of NASA\u2019\u0080\u0099s former shuttle-processing hangars. Another mission using the X-37B is scheduled to launch from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, located just south of the Kennedy Space Center, later this year. How long the X-37B will orbit this time, and what exactly it will be doing, is known only by a handful of people in the Department of Defense.

Questions Background Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by Christopher Woody, Business Insider) \u2013 In the early morning hours of May 7, 1945, the remnants of Nazi Germany\u2019s military leadership signed an unconditional surrender to Allied forces in France . (Hitler had committed suicide on April 30th.) When the news broke the next day, soldiers and civilians around the world heralded \u2014 the Soviet Union would mark Victory Day on May 9 \u2014 exuberant about the end of nearly six years of war that had\u00a0destroyed much of Europe. Victory in Europe Day (VE Day) When German and Allied military officials gathered again in Berlin  near midnight on May 8 to sign surrender documents, the atmosphere in the room was laden with emotional and political weight. The Germans, characteristically severe, went through the proceedings in a mix of resignation and resentment, while the Soviets, Americans, and other Allies were relieved at the war\u2019s conclusion. All of them were uncertain what would come next. Historian Antony Beevor\u2019s  sweeping history of the final months on the eastern front, \u201cThe Fall of Berlin 1945,\u201d  captured\u00a0the mood in the room as victors and vanquished gathered to bring their conflict to an end: \u201cJust before midnight the representatives of the allies entered the hall \u2018in a two-storey building of the former canteen of the German military engineering college in Karlshorst.\u2019 General Bogdanov , the Russian commander of the\u00a02nd Guards Tank Army, and another Soviet general sat down by mistake on seats reserved for the German delegation.\u201d \u201cA staff officer whispered in their ears and \u2018they jumped up, literally as if stung by a snake\u2019 and went to sit at another table. Western pressmen and newreel cameramen apparently \u2018behaved like madmen\u2019. In their desperation for good positions, they were shoving generals aside and tried to push in behind the top table under the flags of the four allies.\u201d The German delegation then entered the room \u2014 its members looking both \u201cresigned\u201d and \u201cimperious.\u201d Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel , commander of the Nazi armed forces during the final days of the war, \u201csat very straight in his chair, with clenched fists,\u201d Beevor wrote. \u201cJust behind him, a tall German staff officer standing to attention \u2018was crying without a single muscle of his face moving.'\u201d Gen. Georgy Zhukov , a senior Soviet commander during the war\u2019s final days, stood to invite the Germans \u201cto sign the act of capitulation.\u201d Keitel, impatient, gestured for the documents to be brought to him. \u201cTell them to come here to sign,\u201d Zhukov said. Keitel walked over to sign, \u201costentatiously\u201d removing his gloves to do so, unaware that the representative for the chief of Stalin\u2019s secret police, the NKVD, was lingering just over his shoulder. \u201c\u2018The German delegation may leave the hall,'\u201d Zhukov said once the signing was complete, Beevor wrote, adding: \u201cThe three men stood up. Keitel, \u2018his jowls hanging heavily like a bulldog\u2019s, raised his marshal\u2019s baton in salute, then turned on his heel. As the door closed behind them, it was almost as if everybody would in the room exhaled in unison. The tension relaxed instantaneously. Zhukov was smiling, so was [ British Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur] Tedder . Everybody began to talk animatedly and shake hands. Soviet officers embraced each other with bear hugs.\u201d \u201cThe party which followed went on until almost dawn, with songs and dances. Marshal Zhukov himself danced the Russkaya  to loud cheers from his generals.

After affixing his signa\u00adture, 54-year-old Jodl addressed his audi\u00adence, saying: \u201cAt this hour, we [he meant the Ger\u00adman nation and Ger\u00adman Armed Forces] can only hope that the vic\u00adtors will be gene\u00adrous.\u201d Eisen\u00adhower coolly responded that \u201cthe Ger\u00adman Supreme Com\u00admander will appear for the sur\u00adrender to the Rus\u00adsians at the time and the place that the Rus\u00adsian High Com\u00admand will designate.\u201d Following the signing cere\u00admony Eisen\u00adhower in\u00adformed the Allied War Office in Lon\u00addon: \u201cThe mis\u00adsion of this Allied Force was fulfilled at 0241, local time, May\u00a07, 1945.\u201d The next day in Berlin, May\u00a08, 1945, Field Marshal Wil\u00adhelm Kei\u00adtel, head of the entire OKW, along with repre\u00adsen\u00adta\u00adtives of the Ger\u00adman Navy and Air Force, signed a second uncon\u00addi\u00adtional sur\u00adrender docu\u00adment in Berlin-Karls\u00adhorst.

The Ger\u00adman Reich Adolf Hitler had said would endure a thou\u00adsand years lasted a pitiful and extremely painful dozen. (from The Daily Chronicles of WWII ) VE day \u00a0(Victory in Europe day) is held on May 8th. VE day commemorates the end of the Second World War in Europe, when the forces of Nazi Germany surrendered to the Allied forces (major allies were: Britain, France, U.S. and Soviet Union, and\u00a0other allies including China). The Japanese continued to fight the Americans until August 15th 1945. This date is known as VJ day  (Victory in Japan day). In depth The Second World War lasted 6 years from 1939 to 1945. Sixty million  people in Europe, Africa and Asia were killed (approximately 20 million were from the Soviet Union \u2013 at least half civilians ). Over 415,000 U.S. troops\u00a0were WWII casualties. \u00a0[Do an internet search for exact numbers.] Six million Jewish people were killed by the Nazis. On May 7th 1945, the German High Command signed an unconditional surrender document. To give time for the news to spread to the fighting soldiers, it was agreed that the ceasefire should be at 00.01 on the 9th May. However, enthusiastic journalists broke the news early and spontaneous celebrations began almost immediately. Church bells rang out across the land and churches were packed as people went to give thanks to God that, after 6 long years of suffering, victory had finally arrived. VE Day in Britain, 1945 In Britain people gathered on the streets, many dressed in red, white and blue, to sing and dance, hugging each other, relieved that the war was finally over. Britain and Western Europe decided to celebrate VE day on May 8th with street parties and fancy dress parades for the children. In Russia VE day is celebrated on May the 9th, the official date the war ended. Food was rationed, so people had to pool together their coupons to have enough to provide party food. Many of the street party decorations were handmade. Decorations could not be easily bought in war-weary England. Russia and the rest of Eastern Europe stuck to the original agreement and still celebrate on the 9th May. King George VI and Queen Elizabeth waved to cheering crowds from the balcony of Buckingham Palace. Their daughter, Princess Elizabeth (who became the present Queen Elizabeth II) and her sister Princess Margaret mingled anonymously with the huge crowds in the Mall and Trafalgar Square. Crowds gathered in London\u2019s Trafalgar Square to celebrate Germany\u2019s surrender and the end of the war in Europe (VE Day). Official announcement by Winston Churchill British Prime Minister Winston Churchill officially announced the surrender of Nazi Germany which was broadcast around the world to British soldiers. He gave thanks to God and then went to join the Royal family on the balcony of Buckingham palace and told the crowds. \u201cThis is your victory\u2026 Advance Britannia.\u201d The celebrations continued all night with fireworks and bonfires where images of Hitler were burnt and many pubs ran out of alcohol. Some 500,000 Americans flooded New York City\u2019s Times Square to celebrate VE Day 1945.

Questions Background Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by Ori Lewis, Reuters) JERUSALEM \u2014 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  on Sunday symbolically threw away\u00a0a Hamas policy paper published last week that set out a\u00a0supposed\u00a0softening of the Palestinian Islamist group\u2019s stance toward Israel. In a document issued last Monday, Hamas said it was dropping its longstanding call for Israel\u2019s destruction, but said it still rejected the Jewish state\u2019s right to exist and continued to back \u201carmed struggle\u201d against it. [Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal introduced the \u201cpolitical document of principles and general policies\u201d at a press conference in Doha, Qatar, where he lives in exile.] The Israeli government has said the document aimed to deceive the world that Hamas was becoming more moderate. Netanyahu, in a 97-second video clip aired on social media on Sunday, said that news outlets had been taken in by \u201cfake news.\u201d Sitting behind his desk\u2026the prime minister said that in its \u201chateful document,\u201d Hamas \u201clies to the world.\u201d He then pulled up a trash can, crumpled the document into a ball and tossed it away. \u201cThe new Hamas document says that Israel has no right to exist, it says every inch of our land belongs to the Palestinians, it says there is no acceptable solution other than to remove Israel\u2026 they want to use their state to destroy our state,\u201d Netanyahu said. Founded in 1987 as an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, the banned Egyptian Islamist movement, Hamas has fought three wars with Israel since 2007 and has carried out hundreds of armed attacks in Israel and in Israeli-occupied territories. Many Western countries (including the U.S. and the European Union) classify Hamas as a terrorist group over its failure to renounce violence, recognize Israel\u2019s right to exist and accept existing interim Israeli-Palestinian peace agreements. Outgoing Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal  said Hamas\u2019s fight was not against Judaism as a religion but against what he called \u201caggressor Zionists.\u201d Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas\u2019s leader in the Gaza Strip , was named on Saturday to succeed Meshaal.

Background HAMAS: Hamas \u00a0is a Palestinian Sunni Islamist terrorist organization that currently (since January 2006) forms the majority party of the Palestinian Authority Hamas is known outside the Palestinian territories for its suicide bombings and other attacks directed against Israeli civilians, as well as military and security forces targets. Hamas\u2019 charter\u2026calls for the destruction of the State of Israel and its replacement with a Palestinian Islamic state in the area that is now Israel, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip In January 2006, Hamas won a surprise victory in the Palestinian parliamentary elections. \u00a0Many [Palestinians]\u00a0perceived the preceding Fatah government as corrupt and ineffective. Since Hamas has taken control, the Palestinian territories have experienced a period of sharp internal conflicts, known as Fauda (anarchy), in which many Palestinians have been killed in\u2026fighting [between Hamas supporters and Fatah supporters].

Questions Background Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (Associated Press at CBS News)\u00a0 \u2013 Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin  says his department is seeking to close perhaps more than 1,100 VA facilities nationwide as it develops plans to allow more veterans to receive medical care in the private sector. At a House hearing Wednesday, Shulkin said the VA had identified more than 430 vacant buildings and 735 that he described as underutilized, costing the federal government $25 million a year. He said the VA would work with Congress in prioritizing buildings for closure and was considering whether to follow a process the Pentagon had used in recent decades to decide which of its underused military bases to shutter, known as Base Realignment and Closure, or BRAC. \u201cWhether BRAC is a model that we should take a look, we\u2019re beginning that discussion with members of Congress,\u201d Shulkin told a House appropriations subcommittee. \u201cWe want to stop supporting our use of maintenance of buildings we don\u2019t need, and we want to reinvest that in buildings we know have capital needs.\u201d Veterans Affairs medical center in West Los Angeles \u2013 Building 205, pictured here, sits vacant. It was designated as future housing for disabled homeless veterans in 2007. (NPR, Sept. 10, 2012) In an internal agency document obtained by The Associated Press, the VA pointed to aging buildings it was reviewing for possible closure that would cost millions of dollars to replace. It noted that about 57 percent of all VA facilities were more than 50 years old. Of the 431 VA buildings it said were vacant, most were built 90 or more years ago, according to agency data. The VA document did not specify the locations. While President Donald Trump\u2019s budget blueprint calls for a 6 percent increase in VA funding, Shulkin has made clear the government\u2019s second-largest agency with nearly 370,000 employees will have to operate more efficiently and that budget increases should not be considered a given in future years. The department recently announced hiring restrictions on roughly 4,000 positions despite the lifting of the federal hiring freeze and also left open the possibility of \u201cnear-term\u201d and \u201clong-term workforce reductions.\u201d Shulkin is also putting together a broader proposal by fall to expand the VA\u2019s Choice program of private-sector care. The Pentagon\u2019s BRAC process often stirred controversy in the past as members of Congress expressed concern about the negative economic impact of shuttering military bases and vigorously opposed closures in their districts. Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, R-Neb., a vice chair of the appropriations panel, told Shulkin that Congress was looking forward to working with the VA \u201cconstructively\u201d on the issue in part by determining how excess VA buildings could be put to good community use, such as for fire-fighting, security or landscape maintenance. \u201cDon\u2019t ever use the term BRAC because it brings up a lot of bad memories,\u201d Fortenberry cautioned. \u201cYou automatically set yourself up for a lot of controversy.\u201d In effort to curb further missteps by the department, President Trump recently signed an executive order \u00a0to establish an within the VA. Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection \u201cThe Office will help the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to discipline or terminate VA managers or employees who fail to carry out their duties in helping our veterans. The Office will also identify barriers to the Secretary\u2019s authority to put the well-being of our veterans first,\u201d the order says. The VA has been treading carefully three years after the wait time scandal that plagued the department nationwide. Shulkin told CBS News back in April that there\u2019s a \u201cbipartisan\u201d commitment to fixing the VA under Mr. Trump.

How old are the buildings being considered for possible closure? 5. a) What is private-sector care? b) CHALLENGE: The ongoing VA scandal, which was reported in detail in 2014 (see \u201cBackground\u201d and \u201cResources\u201d below) was about unacceptably long wait-times to see a doctor and/or specialist, and unnecessarily long wait-times to receive treatment. Instead of fixing the crisis, President Obama\u2019s VA Secretary changed the way veterans evaluated the VA from asking how patients rated the time it took to actually see a doctor and get treated to how the patients rated the quality of the doctors and treatment they received. He then said the VA was getting great ratings from veterans. The Senate and House both have standing Committees on Veterans Affairs, yet over the years, the terrible treatment our vets receive has not improved. To fully understand the magnitude of this problem, you must read about it. (See \u201cBackground\u201d and \u201cResources\u201d below.) Do you think offering veterans private-sector care could solve the problem? Explain your answer. c) Ask a parent the same question. Discuss your answers. 6. The problem with closing some under-utilized facilities is that those vets who do use them would have to now travel far for their medical care. Would the option of using private-sector medical care be a good solution for this problem? Explain your answer. 7. a) The crisis with VA medical care for our veterans was publicized in detail after a whistleblower doctor came forward. Many who would have done the same did not come forward because they were afraid it would cost them their jobs. What did President Trump do to protect whistleblowers? b) What exactly will this office do? 8. a) President Trump has promised to fix the VA. Do you think he will succeed where Presidents Bush and Obama and Congress have failed for so many years? (Is he being naive? Is expecting results from Secretary Shulkin realistic? Can such a large federal government agency be fixed?) Explain your answer. b) Ask a parent the same question. Discuss your answers. CHALLENGE: Re-read the first sentence in paragraph 2.

Background From a May 5, 2014 editorial by Betsy McCaughey at NYPost: At the end of April 2014, the nation was shocked by charges that more than 1,400 vets lingered and 40 died on a secret waiting list at the Phoenix, Ariz., Veterans Administration medical center. The list was concocted to conceal long waits for care. But what you haven\u2019t heard is even worse: VA hospitals across America are manipulating the official electronic waiting list, and the deadly coverups have been going on for years. The dirty tricks at the Phoenix VA came to light on April 24 when retired VA physician Sam Foote exposed how the hospital evaded legal requirements that patients be seen promptly. But Congress has known since the 1990s about vets at many VA facilities waiting hundreds of days for care and sometimes dying in line. In 1996, Congress passed a law requiring that any vet needing care be seen within 30 days. The General Accountability Office reported in 2000, and again in 2001, that excessive waiting was still a problem. In 2007, and again in 2012, the VA\u2019s own inspector general reported that VA schedulers routinely cheated to hide long waits. The abuse was vividly documented in a March 2013 hearing of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs, more than a year before the Phoenix scandal broke. \u00a0 Debra Draper, the GAO\u2019s director of health care, told Congress that the GAO visited four VA medical sites and found that more than half the schedulers were manipulating the system to conceal how long vets wait to see a doctor. Roscoe Butler, an American Legion investigator, described seeing similar tricks. Asked if the VA could correct the problem, Draper was skeptical. Veterans\u2019 demand for medical care exceeds the VA\u2019s capacity. Again and again, VA bureaucrats have responded to that problem by lying, gaming the electronic-monitoring system and making false promises to the public. All the while, vets suffer needlessly. On Jan. 30, it was disclosed that at least 19 veterans at VA facilities in Columbia South Carolina and Augusta Georgia died in 2010 and 2011 because they had to wait too long for colonoscopies and endoscopies that could\u2019ve diagnosed their cancers while still treatable. The practical answer is to provide vouchers or health plans for vets who need colonoscopies, heart care, diabetes management and other treatment for non-combat-related conditions so they can escape the wait lists and use civilian doctors and hospitals. A bipartisan proposal offered by Reps. Peter King (R-LI) and Steve Israel (D-LI) urges that vets needing mental-health care be referred to civilian caregivers.

Questions Background Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by Ruth Brown, New York Post) \u2013 On Thursday, surviving veterans from the U.S. and Australia\u00a0met with President Trump and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on board the USS Intrepid in New York\u00a0to finally give the little-known WWII the recognition it deserves, at a gala dinner hosted by the American Australian Association. Battle of the Coral Sea Most people are familiar with the which occurred a month later, where the allies first inflicted a major blow against the Japanese, but it was Coral Sea was where the tide first started to turn, according to the association\u2019s president, Battle of Midway former ambassador to Australia John Berry .\u00a0\u201cIt was an ugly war, but we were on the offensive. It shifted from defense to offense at the Coral Sea,\u201d said Berry. Until that point, Japan seemed unstoppable. It had already toppled Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaya, and the Aussies had just intercepted communications that Japanese forces were about\u00a0to invade New Guinea. Australia was sure to be next. With the British Royal Navy\u2019s regional forces decimated from earlier battles, and the rest of its troops tied up fighting Hitler in Europe, Adm. Chester Nimitz, commander in chief of America\u2019s Pacific Fleet , answered the Aussies\u2019 SOS without a second thought. \u201cThe captain told us this was an English country, these are our English counterparts,\u201d recalls John Hancock , 92, then just 17 and a\u00a0Georgia\u00a0kid fresh from the farm serving aboard the Yorktown. \u201cThey were trying to keep supply lines open to Australia.\u201d John Hancock Nimitz deployed   [Thursday\u2019s event was almost certainly the last major commemoration to be attended by those who fought\u00a0in one of the great sea battles of World War II that also re-defined the nature of naval warfare. two US carrier groups \u2014 one with the USS Yorktown, the other with the USS Lexington  \u2014 while Australian Rear Adm. John Crace  commanded a joint support force that included two Aussie cruisers, the HMAS Australia and HMAS Hobart . The Battle of the Coral Sea was fought entirely by aircraft attacking ships; the opposing ships did not make visual contact or exchange direct fire\u00a0at any time. The air-sea battle was contested\u00a0between May 4 and May 8, 1942. It came about after the Japanese dispatched an invasion fleet to take Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea  in early May, 1942. They also sent a carrier force to patrol into the Coral Sea to intercept any American carriers sent to thwart their planned attack. The Japanese landed at Tulagi in the Solomon Islands on May 2 as their invasion fleet, protected by carrier air support, headed towards Port Moresby on the south coast of Papua. The Allies had cracked the main Japanese codes and deciphered Japanese radio messages. This enabled an American carrier force, supported by Australian cruisers and destroyers, to wait and intercept the invaders after Admiral Nimitz had ordered his two available carrier groups, Rear Admiral Frank Fletcher\u2019s  Task Force 17, built around USS Yorktown\u00a0 and Rear Admiral Aubrey Fitch\u2019s  Task Force 11, centred on USS Lexington , into the Coral Sea. The Allied group was under the command of Rear Admiral Fletcher of the United States Navy . Rear Admiral John Crace commanded the Australian  heavy cruisers Hobart  and Australia  in the joint taskforce.] The two sides began dueling from a distance on May 4, but the real battle began on May 7, when US planes discovered a Japanese light carrier and tore it apart in a hail of bombs and torpedoes, killing 638 Japanese fighters. The Japanese exacted some damage of their own, taking out a US oiler and a destroyer, but their attempts to sink Crace\u2019s force were largely a bust, thanks to the Aussies\u2019 fearless defense. The two Australian cruisers skillfully outmaneuvered the onslaught while their men blasted back into the skies. \u201cThe captain drove the Hobart like a Formula One motor car to dodge the torpedo and bombs,\u201d Gordon Johnson, then a 19-year-old , recently told the national daily The Australian. \u201cThey strafed the ship with machine guns, and along with our anti-aircraft guns and the whine of the turbines, the noise was extraordinary. It was like putting your head in an empty 44-gallon drum and someone whacking it with a hammer.\u201d The next morning, the battle reached its brief, bloody climax as both sides discovered and attacked their counterparts\u2019 most valuable assets: the carriers. The Americans hit first, sending out 75 aircraft that did serious damage to an enemy carrier, but the flyboys struggled to see the other boats, which were obscured by bad weather. Then the Japanese hit back, and suddenly, the Americans\u00a0were in the thick of battle. \u201cI fired at the Japanese planes, like everybody else did, [but] who knows who was shot and who was hit,\u201d Hancock recalls. \u201cI fired about five canisters \u2014 and there are 250 rounds in a canister.\u201d \u2026The Yorktown came out relatively unscathed \u2014 it had dodged eight torpedoes and was hit by only a single bomb. But 66 men were killed or seriously injured. The Lexington \u2014 the slower of the two carriers \u2014 fared worse. Its captain evaded five torpedoes but two found their target, sparking a fire that tore through the ship. [The Lexington lost 216 men, but thousands made it out alive.] The craft remained afloat for the battle but was ultimately too damaged to continue, and the crew abandoned ship before it was scuttled . \u2026 The Allies didn\u2019t actually win the battle \u2014 Tokyo considered it a tactical victory because its forces had sunk the largest ship \u2014 but they did enough damage to take Japan\u2019s newest carriers out of commission, which proved to be a decisive advantage at Midway. And it introduced our naval leaders to the new realities of warfare on the seas. \u201cThis was the first naval sea battle where the ships never see each other \u2014 they were five hours apart by sea, 20 minutes by air. The devastation that\u2019s wrought by air shows everybody that naval warfare has totally changed,\u201d says Australia\u2019s John Berry. Coral Sea also halted Japan\u2019s advance toward Australia \u2014 and it is something the Aussies have never forgotten.  [Over four days more than 70 aircraft and ships were destroyed, but the Japanese advance south\u00a0was successfully halted and the prospect of an invasion of Australia ended. More importantly, it was the first time the Japanese had been halted during their southwards advance across\u00a0the Pacific.] Reprinted here for educational purposes only.

Background The Battle of the Coral Sea was a tactical victory for the Imperial Japanese Navy \u2013 they lost fewer resources \u2013 but a strategic victory for the U.S.Navy. We\u00a0stopped the planned Japanese invasion of Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea. Japanese Imperial Army units slated for this operation were diverted to Guadalcanal, where they were consumed in the battle of attrition there. (from a commenter at usmilitaryforum) The Allied force had 128 carrier aircraft and the Japanese had 127 carrier aircraft: U.S. Task Force 11  included the USS Lexington, commanded by Rear-Admiral Fitch.\u00a0Task Force 11 consisted of USS Lexington (carrier), Minneapolis (heavy cruiser), New Orleans (heavy cruiser), Phelps (destroyer), Dewey (destroyer), Farragut (destroyer), Aylwin (destroyer) and the Monaghan (destroyer) U.S. Task Force 17 \u00a0included the USS Yorktown, commanded by Rear-Admiral Fletcher, together with protective cruisers and destroyers.\u00a0Task Force 17 consisted of USS Yorktown (carrier), Astoria (heavy cruiser), Chester (heavy cruiser), Portland (heavy cruiser), Hammann (destroyer), Anderson (destroyer), Russell (destroyer), Walke (destroyer), Morris (destroyer) and Sims (destroyer) Australian Task Force 44 commanded by the Australian Rear-Admiral Crace and consisting of a group of Allied warships, including the heavy cruiser HMAS Australia and the light cruiser HMAS Hobart whose target was the Japanese Port Moresby Invasion Group The Japanese force included the aircraft carriers \u2018Shokaku\u2019, the \u2018Zuikaku\u2019 and the \u2018Shoho\u2019. The Japanese attack on Port Moresby, codename \u2018Operation MO\u2019, was important as its success would isolate Australia and New Guinea and could then be used as a platform to attack Samoa and Fiji. Port Moresby was a key city on the southern coast of New Guinea.

(Photo: Hubert Van Es, UPI) Jump to... Questions Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by Thom Patterson, CNN) \u2014 The CIA Air America helicopter bounced as it touched down on an aging apartment building in Saigon. Its pilot knew there was no room for error. Scores of were lined up on that rooftop, waiting anxiously to scramble aboard his chopper. They knew 150,000 South Vietnamese were just outside the city, ready to pounce. North Vietnamese communist troops Delicately working the controls, the pilot reduced power just enough to set down but leaving enough lift in the spinning rotor to keep much of the aircraft\u2019s weight off the rickety roof. He held steady, while desperate men, women and children, some carrying luggage, hoisted themselves inside the vibrating aircraft. The pilot made sure they stayed clear of the deadly rotor blades while he avoided rooftop antennas that could trigger a crash. After 15 passengers squeezed into a compartment meant for nine, it was time to go. Very slowly, the pilot raised the aircraft and pointed the helicopter forward. About 40 minutes later, the evacuees landed safely aboard a U.S. Navy ship offshore. Now, imagine doing that again. And again. And again. All day long. No sleep, little food. Overbearing tension. [April 30th\u00a0marked 42] years since the largest helicopter airlift in history, Operation Frequent Wind. By the time it was over, about 100 Marine, Air Force and Air America choppers had evacuated an estimated 7,000 Americans and South Vietnamese out of Saigon in under 24 hours. The airlift was prompted by some harsh realities. U.S. combat forces had been out of the war for two years after a ceasefire agreement with the North. U.S. President Richard Nixon had promised to respond with \u201cfull force\u201d if the North violated the ceasefire. But now Nixon was powerless \u2013 forced out of office and disgraced by the Watergate scandal. Bottom line: South Vietnam was about to lose the war. A city gripped by fear U.S. authorities faced excruciatingly difficult questions: When to leave? Who should be allowed to go? How to evacuate? No one knew how it would all play out. And the entire world was watching. Chaos ruled the city. There were fears about massive arrests, \u201cre-education\u201d camps and executions at the hands of the communists. Thousands of Americans and their Vietnamese family members wondered how \u2014 or even if \u2014 they were going to safely escape. The airlift was triggered by a North Vietnamese attack on Saigon\u2019s airport, which ruined runways and made a mass airplane evacuation impossible. The only option left, planners said, was to use helicopters, which were slower and smaller than planes. The chopper option was the least desirable and the most hazardous, pilots said. It must have sounded very weird when American Forces Radio broadcast Bing Crosby\u2019s \u201cWhite Christmas\u201d on the morning of April 29 and announced \u201cthe temperature is 105 degrees and rising.\u201d That was the signal. Americans and hand-picked Vietnamese began heading toward predetermined assembly spots. was on. Operation Frequent Wind \u201cAt the time, you realized it was historic,\u201d retired told CNN. Col. Gerry Berry Which rooftop? \u2018We just picked one\u2019 Berry was then a 30-year-old U.S. Marine Corps helicopter pilot whose orders were simple: get the American ambassador out of the U.S. Embassy. But as he learned later, nothing turned out to be simple that day. , 32, flew choppers for Tony Coalson Air America, the CIA air service . Coalson was assigned the dangerous task of landing on unfamiliar rooftops throughout the city, picking up unknown evacuees and flying them to staging areas or U.S. Navy ships offshore. \u201cThere were so many rooftops that we didn\u2019t know, really, what rooftop was what,\u201d Coalson told CNN. \u201cWe just picked one out, and we landed there.\u201d Air America pilot told CNN how his rooftop chopper rescue led to one of the most iconic photos of the era. And Robert Caron shared his experience as crew chief of the last U.S. chopper to leave the embassy, shutting the door on America\u2019s involvement in Vietnam. Chris Woods Air America choppers started the evacuation flights early that morning, with about 17 helicopters taking part, both military and civilian versions of the famous UH-1 \u201cHuey.\u201d The original plan called for most flights to arrive and depart from the U.S. Defense Attache Office, near the airport. But as word of the evacuation spread, thousands of Vietnamese began heading to the embassy compound. Soon, planners realized more choppers had to be sent to the embassy. South Vietnamese civilians scaled the 14-foot wall of the US embassy in Saigon, trying to reach evacuation helicopters as the last Americans departed from Vietnam on April 29, 1975. (AP file photo) Thick crowds jammed the gates, some holding papers claiming they had worked for the Americans. Others said they were dependents of American citizens. Many feared their U.S. connections would put them in danger under a North Vietnamese regime. Embassy Marine guards chose who to let inside. \u201cIt actually just went beyond chaos,\u201d Coalson said. \u201cIt was indescribable. And it was like a tsunami of people.\u201d Hailing from Oxford, Alabama, this was Coalson\u2019s second time serving in South Vietnam. He\u2019d flown Hueys in the Army in 1967 and \u201968. He\u2019d been flying with Air America since 1970. On April 29, Coalson flew alone, without a co-pilot. Often when he would land on a rooftop, his chopper would be \u201cmobbed by people. You had to watch your tail rotor so somebody didn\u2019t walk into that.\u201d For a lone pilot, cutting off the stream of anxious evacuees when the chopper filled up was tricky. He couldn\u2019t leave the cockpit. And the passengers wouldn\u2019t stop trying to get aboard. So, Coalson used his chopper to give them a hint that he was leaving. \u201cYou just slowly start to lift up, very, very slowly,\u201d Coalson said. \u201cAnd people knew, \u2018Well, if we can\u2019t get in, we\u2019re certainly not gonna be able to get on, because this aircraft, I think, is takin\u2019 off\u2019 \u2014 which it was.\u201d Coalson flew more than 10 hours that day without rest. Other pilots reported that some evacuees wouldn\u2019t let go. As the choppers took off, they\u2019d find themselves dangling from the landing skids until the pilot was able to shake them off. Iconic photograph At about 2:30 p.m., 41-year-old Caron unintentionally starred in one of the most famous photographs of the Vietnam War. It happened because CIA air officer asked Caron and co-pilot Oren \u201cO.B.\u201d Harnage to pick up \u201cthe deputy prime minister and his family.\u201d Jack \u201cPogo\u201d Hunter United Press International\u2019s photographed Caron and Hunter\u2019s chopper perched atop Saigon\u2019s Pittman Building, about a half-mile from the embassy. In the picture, Harnage is seen standing on the roof, helping evacuees climb a ladder to get on board. The iconic photograph has come to symbolize the chaos and desperation of that day. Hugh van Es Pittman Building, Saigon, April 30, 1975. (Photo: Hubert Van Es, UPI) \u201cI remember looking out there at the people coming up the ladder,\u201d Caron told CNN. \u201cAnd I turned to Pogo and said, \u2018I tell you what, this prime minister has a pretty damned big family!\u2019 It was 50 people. As you can imagine, as word spread, everyone they knew suddenly became \u2018family.\u2019 \u201d \u2018I\u2019m here to get the ambassador\u2019 The Marines didn\u2019t start their chopper airlift until the afternoon. About 65 U.S. Marine and 10 Air Force choppers took part, Berry recalled. Some helicopters shuttled evacuees from the Defense Attache Office to the Navy fleet. Other pilots, like Berry, were sent to the embassy. Berry grew up in Montana and joined the Marines at 22. No rookie to the Sea Knight, he\u2019d already flown them in combat \u2014 in 1969 and \u201970. \u201cI\u2019d lost a lot of friends,\u201d Berry said. As the end of the war drew near, he feared the sacrifices had been \u201call for naught.\u201d On April 29, at about 1 p.m., Berry\u2019s Sea Knight \u2014 call sign Lady Ace 09 \u2014 landed behind the embassy on a special mission. \u201cI\u2019m here to get the ambassador,\u201d Berry told a Marine guard. But instead of escorting the ambassador aboard, Marine guards loaded Berry\u2019s chopper with 65 to 80 Vietnamese and other non-U.S. evacuees. Not knowing what else to do, Berry flew his passengers offshore to the USS Blue Ridge, where Navy brass were expecting the arrival of the ambassador. He didn\u2019t know it at the time, but Berry was in for a very long day. Lady Ace 09 was just one of a swarm of U.S. helicopters that shuttled back and forth between the fleet and Saigon that day, including powerful Marine CH-53 and HH-53 Air Force choppers, which were too heavy to land on the embassy rooftop helicopter pad. Berry\u2019s first evacuation trip led to another. Then another. \u201cThe first couple times, I always said, \u2018I\u2019m here to get the ambassador.\u2019 \u201d But the attitude of the Marine guards \u201cwas like, \u2018Fine. Tell somebody who cares.\u2019 \u201d With each touchdown on the embassy rooftop, Berry lowered the chopper\u2019s rear loading ramp to allow evacuees to fill the aircraft. Throughout the day, Berry watched the streets fill with residents as enemy tanks approached the city. Each time he returned to the embassy, Berry noticed more people had entered the compound. The evacuation flights didn\u2019t seem to be reducing the crowds. And clearly they all expected to be airlifted out. He began to wonder what was keeping the ambassador. Was he waiting for orders from Washington? Or was he waiting until all the evacuees had gone? Berry said ground fire was his biggest concern. Each time Lady Ace 09 touched down on the embassy roof, it was a sitting target, surrounded by possibly armed South Vietnamese soldiers and civilians. Again the ambassador didn\u2019t show. Berry\u2019s Sea Knight filled with more evacuees bound for the fleet. Coalson\u2019s final flight to the embassy provided one of his most powerful memories. \u201cI landed on the rooftop,\u201d Coalson recalled. \u201cAnd I went down below. And they had a big office down there. And it was really surreal. \u2026 And you had the secretaries. Everybody was in kind of a jovial mood. \u2026 And that\u2019s when \u2014 as you say \u2014 you execute your authority. And you pointed out just: \u201cYou, you, you, up on the deck. And we\u2019re out. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget that.\u201d Choppers pushed overboard There were South Vietnamese pilots who engineered their own evacuations. Some of them commandeered helicopters and flew offshore to meet the American fleet. Some ditched their choppers near the Navy ships and swam the rest of the way. Many South Vietnamese choppers that were able to land on deck were pushed overboard because of a lack of space. When a huge, South Vietnamese Chinook helicopter landed aboard the aircraft carrier USS Hancock, the American sailors and Marines tried to push it over the side. It wouldn\u2019t budge. \u2013 a 23-year-old Marine sergeant and helicopter crew chief \u2013 realized what the problem was. Chris Woods \u201cI kind of \u2018got volunteered\u2019 to go inside the aircraft and release the parking brake. I told everybody, \u2018Don\u2019t start pushing till I get out!\u2019 I climbed in, and released it, but they didn\u2019t wait on me, \u2019cause that thing was rolling backwards. Obviously I jumped out before it went overboard.\u201d Woods remembers the terrible noise the Chinook made when it scraped the Hancock\u2019s rear end, and fell into the ocean with a huge splash. Later that night, Woods was on deck when a Sea Knight with the call sign YT-14 crashed into the water while approaching the carrier. \u201cI remember seeing a big, bright flash, and the Hancock\u2019s warning system going off, and the air boss saying, \u2018Crash! Crash! Crash!\u2019 My heart sank,\u201d Woods said. \u201cIt was rough to take, knowing that our Marine brothers had crashed and were lost at sea.\u201d YT-14 was the final U.S. helicopter lost in Vietnam. The pilots, and Capt. William Nystul , were among the last Americans to die in the conflict. Lt. Michael Shea The magic words It was 4:50 a.m. April 30 aboard Lady Ace 09. Pilots were normally restricted to about six consecutive hours in the cockpit a day. But Berry was into his 17th hour of shuttling back and forth between the fleet and the embassy rooftop helicopter pad without rest. \u201cIt was exhausting,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I felt physical fatigue like I felt mental fatigue. I think mentally, you just got so frustrated with this thing.\u201d Berry landed a 14th time at the U.S. Embassy. Another load of evacuees boarded the aircraft. And once again, the ambassador wasn\u2019t among them. That\u2019s when Berry\u2019s frustration hit the ceiling. \u201cI called the sergeant over. And he got up in the cockpit. And I said, \u2018This is it. Get all these people off. This helicopter\u2019s not leaving the roof until the ambassador\u2019s on board.\u2019 And then, as an afterthought, I said, \u2018The President sends.\u2019 \u201d That was kind of a bold move. To get the sergeant to pay attention, Berry was telling him in Marine-speak that he was \u201csending\u201d a message from the commander in chief. Berry joked to CNN that \u201cin this case, \u2018the President sends,\u2019 was a bit out of my bailiwick.\u201d Nonetheless, those magic words worked. The sergeant removed all the evacuees from the chopper and went downstairs. Two minutes later, Martin and his entourage appeared on the roof and boarded the aircraft. \u201c[U.S. Ambassador] looked very tired, extremely haggard,\u201d Berry recalled. \u201cI\u2019m sure the pressure was immense.\u201d Graham Martin With the ambassador secure aboard the chopper, Berry radioed the code words: \u201ctiger, tiger, tiger\u201d as he headed out to sea. \u201cAnd we land on the USS Blue Ridge.\u201d U.S. Ambassador to South Vietnam Graham Martin speaks to the press aboard the USS Blue Ridge after being evacuated from the U.S. Embassy in Saigon on April 30, 1975. (AP) After 18 hours, 18 minutes of nonstop flying in a war zone, Berry could finally stand down. Mission accomplished. Years later, Berry learned that a 9-year-old Vietnamese boy he evacuated that day had grown up to be a U.S. Marine chopper pilot himself. \u2018Another horrendous screwup\u2019 In Washington, announced it was over. The last U.S. chopper had left the U.S. Embassy. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger But that wasn\u2019t quite accurate. In fact, 11 U.S. Marines had been left on the embassy roof. Kissinger, in the 2014 documentary, called it \u201canother horrendous screwup.\u201d \u201cLast Days in Vietnam,\u201d \u00a0[see \u201cResources\u201d below] Also still on the compound were 420 non-U.S. citizens who, according to the film, were promised airlifts out but instead were left behind. \u201cWe were told that Martin had left on the last helicopter and that the evacuation had ended,\u201d Kissinger said. The Marines barricaded themselves on the roof and prepared to defend themselves against a possible attack. The last men out After sunrise, the USS Hancock sent out a final chopper to rescue the stranded Marines. The mission went to Woods and fellow crewmen of a Sea Knight with the call sign Swift 22. Approaching the embassy, Woods looked down from his position near the cockpit to see the compound was \u201coverrun\u201d by \u201chundreds or thousands\u201d of South Vietnamese. \u201cLike ants on a watermelon, they were just everywhere trying to get up to the rooftop so they could maybe catch a flight out of Saigon.\u201d The chopper set down on the Embassy\u2019s rooftop helicopter pad and Woods opened the ramp and hatch. There had been no attack. After surviving the night uninjured, all 11 Marines ran aboard. Embassy guard trailed last. Master Sgt. Juan Valdez But according to the 2011 book by Bob Drury and Tom Clavin, Valdez almost didn\u2019t make it. \u201cLast Men Out,\u201d Woods said a leaky tear gas grenade on board was threatening to fill the chopper with toxic fumes. \u201cI threw it out the window,\u201d he said. \u201cWe lifted up 10 feet,\u201d but then set down again so one of the pilots could put on his gas mask. With the loading ramp still lowered, the helicopter bounced as it left the roof, and then came back down, according to the book. \u201cValdez rolled out of the chopper \u2026 Three sets of hands shot out\u201d to grab Valdez. But Valdez \u201cwaved them off and got to his knees\u201d and \u201cclambered back aboard,\u201d taking a seat in the aircraft, Clavin and Dury wrote. Woods noticed none of that. He was standing 30 feet away in the front of the cargo hold, near the cockpit, looking for signs of enemy fire and helping the pilots stay clear of dangerous antenna and guy wires as they lifted off. \u201cI was busy \u2026\u201d Woods joked. He remembers a few high fives as the chopper lifted off. One of the Marines marked the time on his watch: 7:58 a.m. April 30, 1975. The world\u2019s largest helicopter airlift was history. The Americans had left the building. \u201cWe were gettin\u2019 out of Dodge pretty quick,\u201d Woods said. Swift 22 carried the embassy\u2019s last Marine security guards to the safety of the awaiting Navy fleet. Less than three hours later, North Vietnamese tanks smashed through the gates of the Presidential Palace. Saigon would be renamed Ho Chi Minh City. After 20 years of involvement, and 58,220 U.S. military deaths, America was finally done with Vietnam. (From an original\u00a0post at\u00a0StudentNewsDaily on May 1, 2015.)

Berry learned years later that a 9-year-old Vietnamese boy he evacuated that day had grown up to be a U.S. Marine chopper pilot himself. Who is that boy? Did the two ever meet? b) What did the 11 Marines left behind (who were finally rescued) think during the time they were barricaded on the roof of the embassy? Who were these 11 men? A book was written about them \u201cLast Men Out\u201d \u2013 can you find any news interviews with these men? c) What happened to the 420 non-U.S. citizens who, according to the 2014 documentary, were promised airlifts out but instead were left behind? Did any of them ever make it out of Vietnam later? d) Who are the \u201cBoat People\u201d? How many made it safely to the U.S.?

Of the 2014 documentary \u201cLast Days in Vietnam,\u201d  NY Post\u2019s Kyle Smith wrote in his review, \u201cLast Days in Vietnam is a testament to American courage\u201d : Amazing details and stories of profound courage, as well as agonizing obtuseness, fill the heartbreaking documentary \u201cLast Days of Vietnam,\u201d Rory Kennedy\u2019s film about America\u2019s disgraceful withdrawal from Vietnam and the heroics of its final hours, told largely via interviews with men who were there \u2013 including the very last embassy guard to board the last helicopter. After the 1974 resignation of Richard Nixon, who had personally guaranteed a forceful response if the North Vietnamese invaded South Vietnam following the 1973 cease-fire agreed by the Paris Peace Accords, the communists were emboldened to rip through the South in 1975. They intended to conquer the country by the date of their dead leader Ho Chi Minh\u2019s birthday \u2013 May 19. The speed of their advance was astonishing, the threat they posed repeatedly denied by the tragic figure at the center here, late Ambassador Graham Martin. Martin is a kind of King Priam of this tale, a man who merits his own major Hollywood film. He had lost his only son in the conflict and was in denial until the moment he drove out to the Saigon airport to see that it had been destroyed by North Vietnamese shelling. And yet such was the man\u2019s sense of honor that when the helicopter arrived at the embassy for him, he refused to board: He sent hundreds of Vietnamese to safety first, in a hastily improvised American airlift so noble and inspiring that it amounts to the one great uplifting tale to emerge from our hideously bungled sojourn to Southeast Asia. That the story has largely gone untold is a shame, and Kennedy (daughter of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy) has done a service to the country in reminding us. As woeful as the end was, the grit of men and women scrambling desperately for freedom ahead of death and/or torture at the hands of the communists makes for a testament to human determination. As for the lifesaving chopper pilots who repeatedly flew passengers 40 at a time from the city to Navy ships at sea, when someone tentatively raised the idea that help might be needed, the reply came back, \u201cMarine pilots don\u2019t get tired.\u201d If only the politicians and the public had known such duty and perseverance.

The company\u2019s public relations department tweeted Tuesday:\u00a0\u201cCNN requested that the advertiser remove the false graphic that says mainstream media is \u2018fake news.\u201d \u201cThe mainstream media is not fake news, and therefore the ad is false. Per our policy, it will be accepted only if that graphic is deleted. Those are the facts,\u201d CNN said in a statement. The Trump campaign criticized\u00a0CNN for the decision not to air the ad\u00a0in a press release sent\u00a0out Tuesday morning that called CNN \u201cfake news\u201d \u2014 the very term to which the network objected. Michael Glassner , the campaign\u2019s executive director said in a statement: \u201cIt is absolutely shameful to see the media blocking the\u00a0positive message that President Trump is trying to share with the country. It\u2019s clear that CNN is trying to silence our voice and censor our free speech because it doesn\u2019t fit their narrative.\u201d In response to CNN\u2019s\u00a0statement that the mainstream is not \u201cfake news,\u201d the campaign put out a second statement from Glassner: \u201cThis is censorship pure and simple. By rejecting our ad, CNN has proven that it supports censorship, is biased and fears an opposing point of view. President Trump\u2019s loyal supporters know the truth: The mainstream media mislead, misguide, deceive, and distract. CNN epitomizes the meaning of fake news and has proven it by rejecting our paid campaign ad.\u201d The campaign spent $1.5 million on the ad, which highlighted Trump\u2019s successful nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, as well as the president\u2019s tax plan. Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel called CNN\u2019s decision to reject the ad \u201cclearly biased.\u201d \u201cFreedom of speech is a hallmark of our nation\u2019s founding, and it is concerning that CNN, who I assume to be a strong supporter of the first amendment, would stifle speech that they disagree with,\u201d McDaniel said in a statement. \u201cCNN should allow the ad to be aired and apologize for their attempt to block the President\u2019s message.\u201d Compiled/adapted from news reports at The Hill and The Daily Caller.

Questions Background Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by Darren Davidson, The Australian) \u2014 Facebook is using sophisticated algorithms to identify and exploit Australians as young as 14, by allowing advertisers to target them at their most vulnerable, including when they feel \u201cworthless\u201d and \u201cinsecure,\u201d secret internal documents \u00adreveal. A 23-page Facebook document seen by The Australian  marked and dated 2017, \u201cConfidential: Internal Only\u201d outlines how the social network can target \u201cmoments when young people need a confidence boost\u201d in pinpoint detail. By monitoring posts, pictures, interactions and internet activity in real-time, Facebook can work out when young people feel \u201cstressed\u201d \u201cdefeated\u201d \u201coverwhelmed\u201d \u201canxious\u201d \u201cnervous\u201d \u201cstupid\u201d \u201csilly\u201d \u201cuseless\u201d and a \u201cfailure,\u201d the document states. [Such information gathered through a system dubbed sentiment analysis could be used by advertisers to target young Facebook users when they are potentially more vulnerable.] After being contacted by The Australian , Facebook issued an apology, and said it had opened an investigation, admitting it was wrong to target young people\u00a0in this way. \u201cWe have opened an investigation to understand the process failure and improve our oversight. We will undertake disciplinary and other processes as appropriate,\u201d a Facebook spokeswoman said in a statement sent to The Australian  at the weekend. Rumors about Facebook\u2019s advertising sales methods have been common\u00a0in media circles for several years, but until now there has been no hard evidence, nor any suggestion they go to such considerable lengths to commercialize their youngest users. In a move that raises profound questions about Facebook\u2019s use of covert surveillance, the document lays out how the world\u2019s biggest social network is gathering psychological insights on 6.4 million \u201chigh schoolers,\u00a0college students\u201d and \u201cyoung Australians and New Zealanders \u2026 in the workforce\u201d to sell targeted advertising. ethical A presentation prepared for one of Australia\u2019s top four banks shows how the $US415 billion advertising-driven giant has built a database of Facebook users in Australlia that is made up of 1.9 million high schoolers with an average age of 16, 1.5 million university\u00a0students averaging 21 years old, and 3 million young workers averaging 26 years old. Detailed information on mood shifts among young people is \u201cbased on internal Facebook data\u201d the document states, \u201cshareable under non-disclosure agreement only\u201d and \u201cis not publicly available.\u201d The document was prepared by two of Facebook\u2019s top Australian executives, David Fernandez and Andy Sinn, and includes information on when young people exhibit \u201cnervous \u00adexcitement\u201d and emotions related to \u201cconquering fears.\u201d The tactics appear to breach the Australian Code for Advertising & Marketing Communications to Children  guidelines which seeks to maintain a high sense of social responsibility . The code defines a child as a person 14 years old or younger, and states a \u201cchild must obtain a parent or guardian\u2019s express consent prior to engaging in any activity that will result in the collection or disclosure of \u2026 personal information.\u201d Personal information is described as \u201cinformation that identifies the child or could identify the child.\u201d The revelations cast new light on how Facebook harvests and uses the extraordinary amounts of data that it gathers on the Australian population to figure out what people are doing and thinking (for the main purpose of making money by selling the information to advertisers). The document claims that Facebook is not only able to detect sentiment, but it can also understand how emotions are communicated at different points during a young person\u2019s week. \u201cAnticipatory emotions are more likely to be expressed early in the week, while reflective emotions increase on the weekend,\u201d the document discloses. \u201cMonday-Thursday is about building confidence; the weekend is for broadcasting achievements.\u201d Extremely detailed\u00a0information that is includes a young person\u2019s relationship status, location, number of Facebook friends they have and how often they access the platform via mobile or desktop. Other moments in young people\u2019s lives Facebook is seeking to sell ads against are associated with \u201clooking good and body confidence\u201d and \u201cworking out & losing weight.\u201d available to advertisers Facebook is also able to reap information on how users are \u201crepresenting emotion and communicating visually.\u201d For example, using image recognition tools, advertisers can see how people visually represent moments such as meal times on the company\u2019s platforms including Instagram, the photo-sharing site that Facebook owns. Because Facebook rolls out ad products on a regional and global basis, the company could be targeting young children around the world with these methods. In its statement to The Australian , Facebook , and refused to disclose if the practice exists elsewhere claims \u201cwe care deeply about the people who use our services\u201d  and \u201cunderstand the importance of ensuring their safety and wellbeing.\u201d The Facebook statement adds: \u201cWhile the data on which this research is based was aggregated and presented consistent with applicable privacy and legal protections, including the removal of any personally identifiable information, our internal process sets a standard higher than required by law. \u2018\u2018Facebook only permits research following a rigorous procedure of review whenever sensitive data, particularly data involving young people or their emotional behavior, is involved. \u201cThis research does not appear to have followed this process.\u201d The engine that drives Facebook\u2019s opaque [unclear; hard to understand]  ad sales system is built on \u2014 sets of complex instructions that Facebook\u2019s engineers use to mine personal information about the preferences of a worldwide audience of 1.86 billion users. algorithms Exactly how the ad sales system work is a closely guarded commercial secret. \u2026 From TheAustralian\u00a0.com.au.

Background Leaked document reveals Facebook conducted research to target emotionally vulnerable and insecure youth (from\u00a0Australia\u2019s news website news.com.au) While Google is the king of the online advertising world, Facebook is the other major player which dominates the industry worth about $80 billion last year. The leaked document shows it has been honing the covert tools its uses to gain useful psychological insights on young Australian and New Zealanders in high school and college and into their 20\u2019s. The social media services we use can derive immense insight and personal information about us and our moods from the way we use them, and arguably none is more fastidious in that regard than Facebook which harvests immense data on its users. The secret document was put together by two Australian Facebook execs and includes information about when young people are likely to feel excited, reflective, as well as other emotions related to overcoming fears. Facebook did not return attempts by news .com.au to comment on the issue but was quick to issue an apology and told The Australian  that it will conduct an investigation into the matter, admitting it was inappropriate to target young children in such a way. \u201cThe data on which this research is based was aggregated and presented consistent with applicable privacy and legal protections, including the removal of any personally identifiable information,\u201d Facebook said in a statement issued to the newspaper. However there is suggestion that the research could be in breach of Australian guidelines for advertising and marketing towards children. Many commentators have suspected Facebook engaged in this sort of cynical exploitation of the data it gathers but the leaked document is scarce proof. Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s company has not been shy about exploring ways it can manipulate the data it collects on users. For one week in 2012, Facebook ran an experiment on some of its users in which it altered the algorithms it used determine which status updates appeared in the news feed of nearly 700,000 randomly selected users based on the post\u2019s emotional content. Posts were determined to be either negative or positive and Facebook wanted to see if it could make the selected group sad by showing them more negative posts in their feed. It deemed it could. The results were published in a scientific journal  but Facebook was criticised by those concerned about the potential of the company to engage in social engineering for commercial benefit. Facebook\u2019s Data Use Policy warns users that the company \u201cmay use the information we receive about you \u2026 for internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research and service improvement.\u201d Currently information about your relationship status, location, age, number of friends and the manner and frequency with which you access the site is sold to advertisers. But according to the report, Facebook is also seeking to sell ads to users concerned with insights gleaned from posts such as those concerned with body confidence and losing weight. More about Facebook from the Australian: News of the questionable sales tactics is the latest in a series of articles by The Australian about Facebook. Last week, this newspaper reported how Facebook is offering rebates to media agencies based on how many staff they employ, and sweetens ad deals with an all-expenses-paid trip to its US headquarters, where founder Mark Zuckerberg is based. Rebates are common in the media industry. But evidence of their existence raises important questions about whether ad buyers are given incentives by Facebook to direct client spend to Facebook regardless of whether such purchases are in an advertiser\u2019s best interest. The Australian  also reported that Facebook\u2019s ad metrics were over-estimated by 500 per cent, far more than previously thought The Australian  revealed that the business had parted company with Australian managing director Stephen Scheeler in February.\u00a0Current Yahoo7 chief executive Ed Harrison is said to be the front runner for his job. Mr. Harrison will have a big rebranding job on his hands if appointed. Australia is the only Facebook market in the world to experience slowing ad growth.

(Photo: Jim Urquhart/Reuters) Jump to... Questions Background Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by Dustin Volz, Reuters)\u00a0WASHINGTON \u2014 The National Security Agency (NSA)  said on Friday it had stopped a form of surveillance that allowed it to collect without a warrant the digital communications of Americans who mentioned a foreign intelligence target in their messages, marking an unexpected triumph for privacy advocates long critical of the practice. The decision to stop the once-secret activity, which involved messages sent to or received from people believed to be living overseas, came despite the insistence of U.S. officials in recent years that it was both lawful and vital to national security. The halt is among the most substantial changes to U.S. surveillance policy in years and comes as digital privacy remains a contentious issue across the globe following the 2013 disclosures of broad NSA spying activity \u00a0by former intelligence contractor Edward Snowden . \u201cNSA will no longer collect certain internet communications that merely mention a foreign intelligence target,\u201d the agency said in a statement. \u201cInstead, NSA will limit such collection to internet communications that are sent directly to or from a foreign target.\u201d NSA also said it would delete the \u201cvast majority\u201d of internet data collected under the surveillance program \u201cto further protect the privacy of U.S. person communications.\u201d The decision is an effort to remedy privacy compliance issues raised in 2011 by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) , a secret tribunal that rules on the legality of intelligence operations, sources familiar with the matter said. The court recently approved the changes, NSA said in its statement. The NSA is not permitted to conduct surveillance within the United States. The so-called \u201cabout\u201d collection went after messages that mentioned a surveillance target, even if the message was neither to nor from that person. That type of collection sometimes resulted in surveillance of emails, texts and other communications that were wholly domestic. The NSA will continue to collect communications directly involving intelligence targets. Friday\u2019s announcement came as a surprise to privacy advocates who have long argued that \u201cabout\u201d collection was overly broad and ran afoul of the U.S. Constitution\u2019s protections against unreasonable searches. Julian Sanchez, a privacy and surveillance expert with the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, called the decision \u201cvery significant\u201d and among the top priorities of surveillance reform among civil liberties groups. \u201cUsually you identify a specific individual to scrutinize their content; this was scrutinizing everyone\u2019s content to find mentions of an individual,\u201d Sanchez said. Other privacy advocates seized on the change to advocate for additional reforms to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). The part of the law under which the banned surveillance occurred, known as Section 702, is due to expire at the end of the year unless Congress reauthorizes it. Democratic Senator Ron Wyden said in a statement he would introduce legislation \u201cbanning this kind of collection in the future.\u201d A U.S. government official familiar with the matter said the change was motivated in part to ensure that Section 702 is renewed before it sunsets on Dec. 31, 2017. FISA has come under increased scrutiny in recent months amid unsubstantiated claims by President Donald Trump and other Republicans that the Obama White House improperly spied on Trump or his associates. Pieces of differing bits of digital traffic are often packaged together as they travel across the internet. Part of the issue with \u201cabout\u201d collection stemmed from how an entire packet of information would be vacuumed up if one part of it contained information, such as an email address or phone number, connected to a foreign target. NSA told the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board as recently as last year that changes to \u201cabout\u201d collection were not \u201cpractical at this time,\u201d according to a report from the government watchdog. News of the surveillance activity being halted was first reported on Friday by The New York Times, which first revealed its existence in 2013, two months after Snowden leaked intelligence documents to journalists.

Background The United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court \u00a0( FISC ) is a\u00a0U.S. federal court\u2026enacted October\u00a025, 1978. It was established by the\u00a0Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act\u00a0of 1978 (FISA) . The FISC oversees requests for surveillance\u00a0warrants\u00a0against suspected foreign\u00a0intelligence agents\u00a0inside the United States by federal law enforcement agencies (primarily the\u00a0F.B.I.). How does the FISA court work? Eleven federal district judges serve on a rotating basis, usually for one week at a time. All judges have a maximum term of seven years with the FISA court. And only one person has the power to appoint the judges: Chief Justice of the United States John Roberts. Congress doesn\u2019t need to confirm which federal judges take on the added responsibility of serving on the FISA court. The judges come from across the country \u2014 in fact, they have to come from at least seven of the US judicial circuits. In theory, those judges can issue warrants from anywhere, said University of Texas law professor and CNN contributor Steve Vladeck. But in practice, the judges usually issue orders during the weeks when they\u2019re \u201con rotation\u201d at the FISA court in Washington.

Jump to... Questions Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by Katie Mettler, The Washington Post) OREGON \u2013 For 10 years, the 82nd Avenue of Roses Business Association has kicked off the city of Portland\u2019s annual Rose Festival with a family-friendly Rose parade meant to attract crowds to its diverse neighborhood. Set to march in the parade\u2019s this year was the\u00a0Multnomah County Republican Party, a fact that so outraged two 67th spot self-described antifascist groups  in the [heavily Democratic] Oregon city that they pledged to protest and disrupt the April 29 event. Then came an anonymous and ominous email, according to parade organizers, that instructed them to cancel the GOP group\u2019s registration \u2014 or else. [While the author of the email did not specify any affiliation to a particular group, they did include links to two different Facebook events of counter-protests; one by Direct Action Alliance  and the other from Oregon Students Empowered .] The anonymous email read in part: \u201cYou have seen how much power we have downtown and that the police cannot stop us from shutting down roads so please consider your decision wisely,\u201d the anonymous email said, referring to the violent riots that hit Portland after the 2016 presidential election, reported  the Oregonian. \u201cThis is nonnegotiable.\u201d The email said that 200 people would \u201crush into the parade\u201d and \u201cdrag and push\u201d those marching with the Republican Party. \u201cWe will not give one inch to groups who espouse hatred toward LGBT, immigrants, people of color or others,\u201d it said. On Tuesday, the business association buckled, announcing it would cancel the parade altogether. [ Republican\u00a0chair James Buchal  said organizers\u00a0asked them to withdraw from the parade, an event they\u2019ve participated in for several years.\u00a0Buchal declined the offer and instead called on Portland Police Chief Mike Marshman, Multnomah County DA Rod Underhill, and Mayor Ted Wheeler to provide security.] Organizers said in a statement, \u201cFollowing threats of violence during the Parade by multiple groups planning to disrupt the event, 82nd Avenue of Roses Business Association can no longer guarantee the safety of our community and have made the difficult decision to cancel the Parade.\u201d  [ Rich Jarvis, a spokesperson for the Rose Festival Foundation , says organizers could not legally un-invite the MCRP to the parade because they were already approved. He added that Venture Portland canceled the event out of an abundance of caution, considering the potential safety impacts to all attendees at the parade. \u201cYou can\u2019t really prevent it. You can be aware, you can be ready, anticipate, but if somebody\u2019s going to do something to interrupt or to attack \u2013 if you want to use that word \u2013 you can\u2019t really be in position to prevent it,\u201d said Jarvis.] The \u201cantifascist\u201d groups   [OregonLive reported; \u201cJarvis\u00a0said the festival has received other threats from local protest groups, who voiced displeasure about the annual Oregon Students Empowered  and Direct Action Alliance  were behind the organized protests scheduled for the parade  Saturday\u00a0but told the Oregonian they had nothing to do with the anonymous email. \u2026 Fleet Week event  in particular. While it would be significantly more difficult to disrupt an event of that magnitude, it\u2019s within the realm of possibility.\u201d] \u201cIt\u2019s all about safety for our fans, first and foremost. If we can\u2019t provide safety for our fans, there\u2019s no use in trying,\u201d Mr.\u00a0Jarvis, the Rose Festival Foundation spokesman told the Oregonian. \u201cOur official position is we\u2019re extremely sad about this.\u201d Online, others were outraged, calling members of the antifascist groups who planned to protest \u201csnowflakes,\u201d \u201canti-American\u201d and \u201ca bunch of chickens and brats.\u201d \u201cShutting down free speech is the (epitome) of fascism,\u201d one person wrote on Facebook. \u201cThis is America.\u201d The free speech uproar in Portland reflects controversies across the country, particularly on college campuses, where speakers with conservative\u2026ideologies have been met with occasionally or threats of protests. violent protests Appearances [on university campuses] by former Breitbart writer Milo Yiannopoulos, [libertarian author and political scientist Charles Murray] and, most recently, conservative commentator Ann Coulter have all been disrupted or canceled [due to protests, despite the fact that student groups had invited the speakers and wanted to hear what they had to say]. In a\u00a0statement, protest group Direct Action Alliance  said it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d that the parade was canceled but added that \u201cno Portland child will see a march in support of this fascist regime go unopposed.\u201d [The \u201cfascist regime\u201d they refer to is President Trump. The parade kicks off the annual Rose Festival and is not a Trump parade.] James Buchal, chairman of the Multnomah County Republican Party , said in a statement  that his group wants the parade to continue. \u201cThe bottom line is that Portland needs to choose between supporting terrorist thugs and protecting average citizens who want to participate in their community,\u201d Buchal said. \u201cThe Multnomah County Republican Party is not composed of \u2018Nazis\u2019 and \u2018white supremacists\u2019 and those who think we would tolerate marching in a parade with folks carrying swastikas are delusional.\u201d Reprinted here for educational purposes only.

Portland, Oregon\u2019s annual Rose Festival has taken place for over 100 years. What is Portland\u2019s Rose parade? 2. As is typical for many local Democrat and Republican party groups in parades across the country, the Multnomah County Republican Party was set to march as usual in this parade. What did two self-described \u201cantifascist\u201d groups threaten to do this year if the Republicans were allowed to march? 3. a) What additional threat was made against the parade through an anonymous email? Be specific. b) What reason did those behind the email give for their threat to \u201cdrag and push\u201d law-abiding citizens out of the parade? c) Define espouse. Do you know any Republicans? Ask them if they espouse hatred toward these groups. 4. a) Before canceling the parade due to threats, what did the organizers ask the Republican group to do? b) What is your reaction to this request? and to the fact that the Republicans declined, but instead asked the police and mayor for protection? 5. The \u201cantifascist\u201d groups who organized protests over the parade due to the Republicans marching said they were not responsible for the threatening email. What do you think? 6. How did James Buchal, chairman of the Multnomah County Republican Party, explain his group\u2019s belief that the parade should continue? How does he defend the MC Republicans? 7. What role do you think the Portland mayor and police department should have in ensuring the right of every citizen who had been approved to march in the parade to be able to do so safely? 8. What do you think: a) Is there a double-standard in Portland? If conservative protest groups opposed a Democratic Party group marching in the parade because they disagreed with their point of view on issues and called for protests against them, would the result have been the same? Explain your answer. b) How should university officials and police and local government officials respond when protesters shut down a talk or threaten marchers in a parade? 9. Fascism \u00a0is defined as: a political system based on a very powerful leader, state control of social and economic life, and extreme pride in country and race, with no expression of political disagreement allowed (Cambridge Dictionary). Why do you think the progressives and anarchists, who forcefully shut down any speech or group they oppose, call those they oppose fascists?

Jump to... Questions Background Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by Patricia Zengerle, Reuters) | WASHINGTON \u2013\u00a0Top Trump administration officials will hold a rare briefing on Wednesday at the White House for the entire U.S. Senate on the situation in North Korea. All 100 senators have been asked to the White House for the 3 p.m. briefing by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said White House spokesman Sean Spicer on Monday. While administration officials routinely travel to Capitol Hill to address members of Congress on foreign policy matters, it is unusual for the entire Senate to go to the White House, and for all four of those top officials to be involved. Aides said they were working with the White House to schedule a similar briefing for the House of Representatives.  [The unusual briefing underlines the urgency with which the Trump administration is treating the threat posed by Pyongyang\u2019s continuing development of nuclear weapons and missile technology. It follows a lunch meeting President Trump held with the UN Security Council ambassadors , including China and Russia, at the White House on Monday where he emphasised US resolve  to stop North Korea\u2019s progress. \u201cThe status quo in North Korea is also unacceptable,\u201d President Trump told the 15 U.N. Security Council ambassadors, including China and Russia, at the White House. \u201cThe council must be prepared to impose additional and stronger sanctions on North Korean nuclear and ballistic missile programs.\u201d \u201cThis is a real threat to the world, whether we want to talk about it or not. North Korea is a big world problem and it\u2019s a problem that we have to finally solve,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople put blindfolds on for decades and now it\u2019s time to solve the problem.\u201d] Washington has expressed mounting concern over North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile tests, and its threats to attack the United States and its Asian allies. President Trump and members of the UN National Security Council at the White House on April 24, 2017. [President Trump hosted a working lunch with the ambassadors from countries on the UN Security Council on Monday and said that they were going to be busy tackling problems that the UN typically avoids addressing. \u201cNorth Korea is a big world problem,\u201d he told the ambassadors. \u201cPeople have put blinders on for decades.\u201d] Wednesday\u2019s Senate briefing was originally scheduled for a secure room at the Capitol, but President Trump suggested a shift to the White House, congressional aides said. Congressional aides suggested the briefing was being held at the White House to underscore the message to North Korea that Washington is serious about wanting a shift in policy (to get tough on North Korean aggression). A senior Trump administration official said the flurry of activity around North Korea was \u201cnot a part of something choreographed\u201d and cautioned against over-interpretation. President Trump has vowed to prevent North Korea from being able to hit the United States with a nuclear missile and has said all options are on the table, including a military strike, although officials say tougher sanctions are the preferred route. Also, on Friday Secretary of State Tillerson is due to chair a UN Security Council meeting on the issue in New York, at which the state department said he would call once more for the full implementation of existing UN sanctions or new measures in the event of further nuclear or missile tests. China, North Korea\u2019s sole major ally, has been angered by its nuclear and missile programs and its belligerence. President Trump spoke by phone\u00a0with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday. Media reports state that President Xi urged President Trump to show restraint toward North Korea despite signs that the North may be preparing a nuclear test.\u00a0But that doesn\u2019t seem to be entirely correct. Chinese media published a full text of the call , and North Korea observer Adam Cathcart noted: \u201cReading the Xi-Trump conversation in the NK embassy in Beijing? Take note of Xi\u2019s praise for mil-mil  cooperation\u201d (between US and Chinese military forces) If you run the text through Google Translate you find Xi wants to \u201csolve the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula as soon as possible and realize the denuclearization of the peninsula.\u201d U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said Washington and the international community were maintaining pressure on North Korean leader Kim Jong Un but \u201cnot trying to pick a fight with him.\u201d Asked whether a pre-emptive strike was under consideration, Ambassador Haley said: \u201cWe are not going to do anything unless he gives us reason to do something.\u00a0If you see him attack a military base, if you see some sort of intercontinental ballistic missile, then obviously we\u2019re going to do that. But right now, we\u2019re saying \u2018don\u2019t test, don\u2019t use nuclear missiles, don\u2019t try and do any more actions\u2019, and I think he\u2019s understanding that. And China\u2019s helping really put that pressure on him.\u201d In recent days Ms. Haley and other US officials have underlined China\u2019s helpfulness in seeking to increase pressure on the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. \u201cWorking with China for the first time \u2014 they have really been our partner in trying to make sure that we hold him at bay, and I think it\u2019s a new day when you\u2019ve got China and the United States working together on a statement to condemn North Korea,\u201d Ambassador Haley said. \u201cThey put pressure on him. He feels it. That\u2019s why he\u2019s responding this way. And I think it is a different day.\u201d President Trump also spoke by phone with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. \u201cWe agreed to strongly demand that North Korea, which is repeating its provocation, show restraint,\u201d Mr. Abe told reporters. \u201cWe will maintain close contact with the United States, keep a high level of vigilance and respond firmly.\u201d Compiled/adapted from news reports at Reuters , Thomson Reuters Foundation  and the UK Guardian.

Security Council. What did he say to the council? 6. China is North Korea\u2019s major ally. President Trump while campaigning made several \u201cundiplomatic\u201d (pro-American) assertions about China. a) What do you learn about U.S. / Chinese relations under Donald Trump? b) Ask a parent: are you surprised by President Trump\u2019s diplomacy in persuading China to take a vocal stand against its ally North Korea\u2019s nuclear program? Please explain your answer. c) Ask a parent: Are you heartened or dismayed by President Trump\u2019s strategy for dealing with North Korea and his insistence that the UN Security Council take a stronger stand? Please explain your answer. 7. President Obama\u2019s stated foreign policy was that of multilateralism (a kind of alliance where multiple countries work together). He was lauded by the media for taking this approach. Unfortunately, during his eight years in office, the U.N. had no success in causing North Korea to stop their nuclear weapons program and belligerence. Critics of President Trump call him a nationalist and/or populist, and use the terms as a negative and even sinister label. Nationalism is defined as: a feeling that people have of being loyal to and proud of their country often with the belief that it is better and more important than other countries. It is true that President Trump does put America first. What do you think of Mr. Trump\u2019s ability to take the lead in the world, using a multilateral approach to addressing the threat the madman Kim Jong Un poses to the U.S. and our Asian allies?

Background THE UNITED NATIONS According to WorldAtlas .com, there are 194 independent countries in the world today. 192 countries are UN members. The exceptions are Taiwan (in 1971, the UN ousted Taiwan and replaced it with the People\u2019s Republic of China) and Vatican City. Kosovo is not yet a member (it is not recognized as an independent country by all). Each country gets one vote in the UN General Assembly. Although there are 192 UN member countries, the U.S. pays at least 22% of the overall yearly budget of the UN. ON THE U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL: (from the website un .org ) The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) is\u00a0charged with the maintenance of international peace and security. Its powers, outlined in the United Nations Charter, include the establishment of peacekeeping operations, the establishment of international sanctions, and the authorization of military action. Its powers are exercised through United Nations Security Council Resolutions. The presidency of the Council is held by each of the members in turn for one month, following the English alphabetical order of the Member States names. U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley is the president this month. There are 15 members of the Security Council, consisting of five veto-wielding permanent members (China, France, Russia, United Kingdom, United States) and ten elected members with two-year terms [these are not eligible for immediate re-election] The ten elected\u00a0members are elected by the General Assembly for two-year terms starting on January 1st, with five replaced each year. The members are chosen by regional groups and confirmed by the United Nations General Assembly. The African bloc chooses three members; the Latin America and the Caribbean, Asian, and Western European and Others blocs choose two members each; and the Eastern European bloc chooses one member. Also, one of these members is an \u201cArab country,\u201d alternately from the Asian or African bloc. Security Council members must always be present at UN headquarters in New York so that the Security Council can meet at any time. This requirement of the United Nations Charter was adopted to address a weakness of the League of Nations since that organization was often unable to respond quickly to a crisis. Each Council member has one vote. Decisions on procedural matters are made by an affirmative vote of at least nine of the 15 members. Decisions on substantive matters (including imposing sanctions on a country) require nine votes, including the concurring votes of all five permanent members. Under the UN Charter, all 191 Member States (countries) of the United Nations agree to accept and carry out the decisions of the Security Council.\u00a0 While other organs of the United Nations make recommendations to Governments, the Council alone has the power to make decisions which Member States are obligated under the Charter to carry out.

Questions Background Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (from the UK\u2019s Metro News) \u2014 More than 70 years ago six million Jewish people were killed during the Holocaust. On Sunday, Jewish communities across the world came together to commemorate those who died at the hands of Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany during World War II during Yom HaShoah. What is Yom HaShoah? Yom HaShoah, or by its full name Yom HaShoah Ve-Hagevurah, is the Hebrew name for Holocaust (Shoah) Memorial Day, literally translated as \u2018Day of the Holocaust and the Heroism.\u2019 The day serves as a memorial of those who died during the Holocaust, giving families time to reflect on the lives lost and educate future generations against anti-semitism. Yom HaShoah is different from International Holocaust Memorial Day [established by the UN], which is\u00a0held on January 27 every\u00a0year to mark the date of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau, the largest of the Nazi concentration camps. When is Yom HaShoah? When does it start and when does it end? The date is always held on the 27th day of the month of Nissan (April/May)\u00a0on the Hebrew calendar \u2013 one week after the end of Pesach (Passover) and one week before Yom Hazikaron, the memorial day for Israel\u2019s fallen soldiers. The 27th day in Nissan also marks the anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising . On the Gregorian calendar, this year Yom HaShoah 2017 started on the evening of Sunday, April 23 and ends in the evening of\u00a0Monday, April 24th. March of the Living The March of the Living is a program that brings Jewish people from all over the world to Poland for Yom HaShoah to march from Auschwitz to Birkenau, the largest concentration camp built during WWII. Yom HaShoah rituals, prayers and events As Yom HaShoah is a fairly recent memorial date, there are no specific established rituals. However, typically synagogues hold memorial services across the globe, where six candles are lit by families of the dead \u2013 one for each of the six million victims \u2013 and the names of those who died are read out. Sometimes these ceremonies are held in graveyards or Holocaust memorials as well. This year in the UK, there will be a memorial service for Yom HaShoah held on May 8th at 2pm at the Barnet Copthall Stadium in London. How Yom HaShoah is commemorated in Israel The sound of a siren is blasted across Israel, stopping traffic and pedestrians in their tracks for a two-minute silence. This usually happens twice during Yom HaShoah \u2013 once at 11am and once at sunset \u2013 a way of commemorating the dead established in the 1960s. All theaters, cinemas, pubs and other public entertainment venues are closed throughout Yom HaShoah. Originally published in May 2016. Reprinted here for educational purposes only.

Yom HaShoah \u00a0(Holocaust Remembrance Day) is observed as Israel\u2019s  day of commemoration for the approximately six million Jews who perished in the Holocaust as a result of the actions carried out by Nazi Germany. In Israel, it is a national memorial day. It was inaugurated in 1953. \u00a0It is held on the 27th of Nisan (April/May), unless the 27th would be adjacent to Shabbat, in which case the date is shifted by a day. Yom HaShoah is also observed by many Jewish communities in the United States and elsewhere in the world. Some other countries have different commemorative days for the same event: . (In 1979, the U.S. Congress established Days of Remembrance of the Victims of the Holocaust (DRVH) as an 8 day\u00a0period for remembrance programs and ceremonies,\u00a0from the Sunday before Yom Hashoah to the Sunday after Yom Hashoah.) wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_Memorial_Days International Holocaust Remembrance Day \u00a0is on January 27 every year and marks the liberation of Auschwitz \u2013 the Nazi death camp \u2013 in 1945. It was designated by a United Nations  General Assembly Resolution in 2005. The resolution came after a special session was held earlier that year, on January 24, 2005 during which the UN General Assembly marked the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi concentration camps and the end of the Holocaust.

(AP Photo/Juan Carlos Hernandez) Jump to... Questions Background Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by Tom Krisher and Joshua Goodman in Caracas for Associated Press, at ABC News) \u2013 General Motors became the latest U.S. corporation to have a factory or other asset seized  by the government of Venezuela, and the Detroit automaker faces an uphill battle to recover any damages. GM said Thursday that its only factory in Venezuela was confiscated \u00a0a day earlier, as anti-government protesters clashed with authorities in a country that is roiled by economic troubles. GM said assets such as vehicles were taken from the plant, causing it irreparable damage. The seizure is the latest in a long string of government confiscations  of factories and other assets that have been a [feature]\u00a0of the 21st century in Venezuela started by the late Hugo Chavez two decades ago. Venezuela is currently fighting claims of socialist revolution illegal asset seizures  at a World Bank-sponsored arbitration panel  from more than 25 companies\u2026 . In March, a World Bank arbitration panel  determined that Venezuela did not have to pay $1.4 billion to Exxon Mobil Corp. for confiscating  company assets during a wave of nationalizations  (in Venezuela, the socialist government has been nationalizing  \u2014 seizing control/ownership of \u2014 privately owned companies. Read more under \u201cBackground\u201d below the questions). Auto production in Venezuela has nearly ground to a halt amid the country\u2019s economic collapse. The cash-strapped socialist government has choked off car companies\u2019 access to dollars needed to import parts and repatriate profits. GM\u2019s factory in the industrial city of Valencia  has not produced a single car since 2015. Nationwide, car makers assembled just 2,849 cars last year, from a peak of 172,218 vehicles in 2007. Despite Venezuela\u2019s grim outlook, many car makers have decided to stay put and avoid the drastic step of shutting down operations to avoid losing market share in case the economy dramatically improves or a more business-friendly government takes power. GM has about 2,700 workers in Venezuela, where it\u2019s been the market leader for over 35 years. It also has 79 dealers that employ 3,900 people, and its parts suppliers make up more than half of Venezuela\u2019s auto parts market, the company said. The Venezuelan government had no comment about the GM factory. In July of last year, the government took control of a factory belonging to Kimberly-Clark Corp. after the U.S. personal care giant said it was no longer possible to manufacture in the crisis-wracked nation due to a lack of materials. President Nicolas Maduro accused Kimberly-Clark of participating in an international plot to damage Venezuela\u2019s economy. Kimberly-Clark joined Bridgestone, General Mills, Procter & Gamble, Ford Motor Co. and other multinational corporations in scaling back operations in Venezuela. Ford suspended operations at its Valencia plant in December due to slumping sales. Toyota said its lone factory in Cumana, Venezuela, continues to operate normally. If the government permits it, GM workers at the Valencia plant will get separation benefits  \u201carising from the termination of employment relationships due to causes beyond the parties\u2019 control,\u201d the GM statement said. Dealers will continue to service vehicles and provide parts, the company said. \u2026 The company recently said that its South America region \u201cremains challenged from macro-economic and political standpoints.\u201d \u2026 Reprinted here for educational purposes only.

Background VENEZUELA \u2013\u00a0About Venezuela\u2019s government: For most of the first half of the 20th century, Venezuela was ruled by generally benevolent military strongmen, who promoted the oil industry and allowed for some social reforms. Democratically elected governments have [ruled] since 1959. Hugo Chavez,\u00a0President of Venezuela from 1999 until his death in 2013, promoted a controversial policy of \u201cdemocratic socialism,\u201d \u00a0which\u00a0[aimed] to alleviate social ills while at the same time attacking globalization and undermining regional stability. (From the CIA World FactBook .) Under the presidency of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, Venezuela saw sweeping and radical shifts in social policy, moving away from the government officially embracing a free market economy and towards quasi-socialist income redistribution and social welfare programs. (from wikipedia) nationalization \u00a0\u2013 refers to the process of a government taking control of a company or industry, which can occur for a variety of reasons. When nationalization occurs, the former owners of the companies may or may not be compensated for their loss in net worth and potential income. What is wrong with the socialist/communist policy of nationalization?: Nationalization destabilizes a society and economy, reduces investment, entrepreneurial innovation and economic growth, and has negative consequences for the majority of the population, including the poor. It sends a message to inhabitants and outside investors that private property is not safe. Nationalization destroys jobs and the profitability of enterprises and is a crime against the general populace. It is bad for consumers, workers, the poor and democracy. (read more at moneyweb.co.za ) (In February 2015, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro ordered the takeover of a Venezuelan private supermarket chain by the government\u2019s food agency.) From an NBC News report : Venezuela finds itself in a volatile state of economic and political crisis, partly because of a failure by the socialist government to deal with the collapse in global oil prices in 2014. Triple-digit inflation and shortages of supplies mean long lines and bare shelves at stores across the country. Many people are suffering from a lack of food, water, medicine and other essentials. On top of this, protests flared three weeks ago after the country\u2019s Supreme Court tried to strip the opposition-controlled parliament of its powers \u2014 a move that would have given almost complete control to President Nicolas Maduro, according to his opponents. The court\u2019s decision was later reversed, but not before people took to the streets demanding elections they believe would remove their increasingly dictatorial government. Resources The AP reports: \u201cOnce among the richest and safest countries in Latin America [which practiced free-market economics], Venezuela is now falling apart. With a plunge in the price of oil and years of mismanagement [under the socialist government], the economy is unraveling. Food is scarce. Crime is rampant. Hospitals barely work. And people are fighting desperately just to survive from day to day.\u201d Watch an April 20, 2017 ABC News report: https://www.studentnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Breaking-point_Chavez-Maduro-socialist-Venezuela_ABC-News.mp4 Recent Daily News Articles Veterans Day 2017: Vets Plan To Boycott NFL Games On Sunday November 10, 2017 EPA approves bacteria-infected insects to kill mosquitoes November 9, 2017 Pa. officials still mostly mum on noncitizens registered to vote November 8, 2017 Tuesday\u2019s World News #1 \u2013 Lebanon November 7, 2017 US deserter Bowe Bergdahl spared prison time November 6, 2017 Get the App Follow Us Elsewhere About  \u00a0\u2014 Site Overview  \u00a0\u2014 Contact Us  \u00a0\u2014 Donate Launched in 2005, StudentNewsDaily.com is a 501(c)3 non-profit educational website.

Marycate Walsh told the publication that \u201cleadership is reviewing the Naval Safety Center\u2019s recommendation regarding e-cigarettes, weighing both the safety and health-related risks.\u201d A Navy memorandum states that 15 \u201cmishaps\u201d occurred between October 2015 and June 15, 2016, that resulted in either injury to Navy personnel or \u201cfire/materiel damage.\u201d \u201cEight of these incidents occurred onboard Naval vessels/aircraft,\u201d the memo reads. \u201cNine of 15 reported incidents described the failure mechanism as explosive. \u2026 Two battery explosions occurred with the electronic cigarette in the service member\u2019s mouth resulting in facial and dental injuries.\u201d The memo says the Navy has no record of any such incidents prior to October 2015. The Navy says there is increased use of e-cigarettes among Navy personnel \u2014 and the apparent dangers have been highlighted in Navy publications. A four-page spread in the Navy magazine Sea Compass titled \u201cDanger: The Hidden Risks of Vaping\u201d tells the story of two sailors who were the victims of an exploding battery. One received first-degree burns, while the other\u2019s car was destroyed by the fire. \u201cImagine what would have happened if the batteries had exploded while in their home, the barracks or even onboard their ship,\u201d the article says. \u201cThe loss of property and potential loss of life could have been catastrophic.\u201d As the Navy has noted, the dangers of exploding batteries can be mitigated by properly stowing the devices, using the correct charger, buying equipment from a reputable manufacturer and not modifying it. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) finalized its first regulations for e-cigarettes last year. The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) formally banned e-cigarette use on commercial flights last year. The ban is meant to protect other passengers from the vapor, due to a lack of information about the ingredients in e-cigarettes. A Navy spokesman says regulations allow personnel to smoke tobacco cigarettes on a ship\u2019s \u201csmoke deck\u201d at designated times. From NPR (National Public Radio).

Background The 80 pilots, navigators, engineers, bombardiers and gunners took off in B-25 Mitchell bombers from the USS Hornet in the Pacific Ocean bound for Japan. A bomber takeoff from the deck of an aircraft carrier had never been done.  The crew found themselves scrambling to make a hasty takeoff, 12 hours ahead of schedule, after they were spotted by Japanese fishing boats. The early departure also meant the planes would likely run out of gas before landing in friendly China. Cole was the co-pilot in the lead plane alongside the commander of the mission, Jimmy Doolittle. (read more at ) CNN The Doolittle Raid ,\u00a0on Saturday, April 18, 1942, was an air raid by the United States of America on the Japanese capital Tokyo and other places on the island of Honshu during World War II, the first air strike to strike the Japanese Home Islands . It demonstrated that Japan itself was vulnerable to American air attack, served as retaliation for the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on Sunday, December 7, 1941, and provided an important boost to American morale. The raid was planned and led by Lieutenant Colonel James \u201cJimmy\u201d Doolittle of the United States Army Air Forces. The raid had its start in a desire by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, expressed to the Joint Chiefs of Staff in a meeting at the White House on 21 December 1941, that Japan be bombed as soon as possible to boost public morale after the disaster at Pearl Harbor. Doolittle later recounted in his autobiography that the raid was intended to bolster American morale and to cause the Japanese to begin doubting their leadership, at which it succeeded: The Japanese people had been told they were invulnerable\u00a0\u2026 An attack on the Japanese homeland would cause confusion in the minds of the Japanese people and sow doubt about the reliability of their leaders. There was a second, and equally important, psychological reason for this attack \u2026 Americans badly needed a morale boost. The concept for the attack came from Navy Captain Francis Low, Assistant Chief of Staff for anti-submarine warfare, who reported to Admiral Ernest J. King on 10 January 1942 that he thought twin-engine Army bombers could be launched from an aircraft carrier, after observing several at a naval airfield in Norfolk, Virginia, where the runway was painted with the outline of a carrier deck for landing practice.\u00a0The attack was planned and led by Doolittle, a famous military test pilot, civilian aviator and aeronautical engineer before the war.

Pence and South Korean acting president Hwang Kyo-ahn , speaking a day after a failed missile test by the North and two days after a huge display of missiles in Pyongyang, also said they would strengthen anti-North Korea defenses by moving ahead with the early deployment of the THAAD missile-defense system . [The Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) is meant to intercept and destroy short- and medium-range ballistic missiles during the last part of their flights.\u00a0China opposes\u00a0THAAD\u2019s deployment, claiming it would compromise its security. (Why do you think they really oppose its placement in South Korea?] Vice President Pence is on the first stop of a four-nation Asia tour intended to show America\u2019s allies, and remind its adversaries, that the Trump administration was not turning its back on the increasingly volatile  region. \u201cJust in the past two weeks, the world witnessed the strength and resolve of our new president in actions taken in Syria and Afghanistan,\u201d Pence said in a joint appearance with Hwang. \u201cNorth Korea would do well not to test his resolve or the strength of the armed forces of the United States in this region,\u201d Pence said.

On a visit to the (demilitarized zone) border between North and South Korea earlier in the day, Pence, whose father served in the 1950-53 Korean War, said the United States would stand by its \u201ciron-clad alliance\u201d with South Korea. \u201cAll options are on the table to achieve the objectives and ensure the stability of the people of this country,\u201d he told reporters as tinny propaganda music floated across from the North Korean side of the demilitarized zone (DMZ). \u201cThere was a period of but the era of strategic patience is over.\u201d strategic patience \u2026.. President Trump\u2019s national security adviser, H.R.

The Trump administration is focusing its strategy on tougher economic sanctions on North Korea, possibly including an oil embargo , a global ban on North Korea\u2019s airline , intercepting cargo ships  and punishing Chinese banks doing business with Pyongyang . Tensions have risen as President Trump takes a hard rhetorical line with Kim Jong Un, who has rebuffed admonitions from China and proceeded with nuclear and missile programs seen by Washington [and much of the world] as a direct threat. \u2026 A North Korean soldier takes photographs during Pence\u2019s visit to the DMZ while another soldier from the Communist country looks on. China banned imports of North Korean coal on Feb. 26, cutting off its most important export and Chinese media has raised the possibility of restricting oil shipments to the North if it unleashed more provocations. [The ban is a massive blow to North Korea, as coal is the nation\u2019s top export and China it\u2019s number one customer.\u00a0China is now importing significant quantities of coal from the United States in order to make up for the coal lost by the North Korean ban.] Pyongyang has conducted several missile and nuclear tests in defiance of U.N. sanctions , and has said it has developed . and would launch a missile that can strike the U.S. mainland U.S. officials and experts believe it is some time away from mastering the necessary technology, including miniaturizing a nuclear warhead.

Questions Background Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by Julia Edwards Ainsley, Reuters) WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0\u2026The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), released figures the first week of April\u00a0showing a 93 percent drop since December of parents and children caught trying to cross the Mexico border illegally. In December, 16,000 parents and children were apprehended; in March, a month in which immigration typically increases because of temperate weather, the number was just over 1,100. It was a remarkable decline \u2013 steeper than the 72 percent drop in overall apprehensions \u2013 but for eight DHS officials interviewed by Reuters it was not surprising. President Trump has spoken about the need to crack down broadly on all illegal  immigrants. But, internally, according to the DHS officials familiar with the department\u2019s strategy, his administration has focused on one immigrant group more than others: women with children, the fastest growing demographic of illegal immigrants. This planning has not been previously reported. In the months since President Trump\u2019s inauguration, DHS has rolled out a range of policies aimed at discouraging [mothers with children] from attempting to cross the border, including tougher initial hurdles for asylum claims and the threat of prosecuting parents if they hire smugglers to get their families across the border. The department has also floated proposals such as separating women and children at the border. DHS Secretary John Kelly  told a Senate hearing on April 5 that the sharp drop in illegal immigration, especially among women and children, was due to President Trump\u2019s tough policies. To date, it has been the threat of new policies rather than their implementation that has suppressed families from coming to the U.S. illegally. Mothers and children aren\u2019t being separated \u2013 and DHS has shelved the plan; parents haven\u2019t been prosecuted, and there is no wall along most of the border. Yet the number of migrants trying to cross \u2013 especially women and children \u2013 has dropped drastically. Asked to comment on the policy of targeting women with children, DHS spokesman Jonathan Hoffman  referenced the March drop, saying, \u201cThose were 15,000 women and children who did not put themselves at risk of death and assault from smugglers to make the trip north.\u201d The White House declined to comment and referred Reuters to DHS. For months, Central Americans had heard about President Trump\u2019s get-tough policies. And public service announcements on radio and television presented bleak pictures of what awaited those who traveled north. Some of the ads were funded by the United States, others by United Nations agencies and regional governments. One radio ad in Honduras featured a mother, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s been a year and I don\u2019t know if she is alive or dead. I\u2019d do anything to have her here with me. Curse the day I sent her north.\u201d The possibility that mothers and children might be separated at the border caused particular alarm, Honduran Deputy Foreign Minister Maria Andrea Matamoros told Reuters \u201cThat worries any mother that wants to go to the United States with their kid, and being separated drastically changes their plans,\u201d she said. The policies focusing on\u00a0women and children have their roots in a working group consisting of Capitol Hill staffers and others called together by President Trump\u2019s transition team in the weeks after the Nov. 8 election. The group was asked to develop policies to discourage illegal border crossings and more quickly expel illegal immigrants after they crossed the border, according to two of the DHS officials and a congressional aide. One goal was to help President Trump fulfill a major campaign promise:\u00a0ending so-called \u201ccatch and release,\u201d the practice of apprehending illegal immigrants but then freeing them to live in the United States while their asylum or deportation cases were resolved. The group quickly identified a major obstacle \u2013 the large numbers of women and children continuing to cross the border, said the DHS officials and the aide. Because a federal court ruling bars prolonged immigration detention of juveniles, the Obama administration released mothers and children to live in the United States while awaiting resolution of their asylum or deportation cases. The incoming Trump administration pointed out that\u00a0the policy encouraged women to make the dangerous journey north with their children in tow. But the new administration was bound by the same court ruling. \u2026.. They needed a solution. The thinking was that \u201cif they can just implement tough policies for eight weeks \u2013 or even threaten to do that \u2013 they would see the numbers of families crossing just plummet,\u201d said one DHS official familiar with the planning. \u2026..

Background The number of children found trying to cross the Mexican border without parents has spiked in recent years. Between 2008 and 2011, 6,000 to 7,500 children per year ended up in the custody of the Health and Human Services Department\u2019s Office of Refugee Resettlement. In 2012 border agents apprehended 13,625 unaccompanied children and that number surged to more than 24,000 in 2013. The spike in children trying cross the border alone forced DHS to divert resources away from other missions, including combating human and drug trafficking, Border Patrol Deputy Chief Ronald Vitiello wrote in a memo on May 30, 2014. The vast majority of migrants who enter the U.S. illegally do so with the help of the coyotes, named after the scavengers that prowl the border. From October 2013 to June 2014, more than 57,000 unaccompanied minors, the vast majority from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, were apprehended at the U.S. border. This was more than double the same period the year before. Many of the children and teenagers who traveled to the United States during the Obama administration said they did so after hearing they would be allowed to stay. People smuggling is a high-risk, often high-yield business estimated to generate $6.6 billion a year for smugglers along Latin America\u2019s routes to the U.S., according to a 2010 United Nations report. The migrants pay anywhere from $4,000 to $10,000 each for the illegal journey across thousands of miles in the care of smuggling networks that in turn pay off government officials, gangs operating on trains and drug cartels controlling the routes north.

Questions Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by Bob Fredericks, New York Post) \u2013 The US has dropped \u201cthe mother of all bombs\u201d on ISIS fighters and hideouts in Afghanistan \u2014 the largest non-nuclear explosive ever used in wartime, the Pentagon said Thursday. The GBU-43B Massive Ordnance Air Blast Bomb , nicknamed MOAB, was dropped at 7 p.m. local time Thursday, military sources told CNN. \u00a0A MOAB \u2014 nicknamed the mother of all bombs \u2014 is a 21,600-pound, GPS-guided munition that is America\u2019s most powerful non-nuclear bomb. \u201cAround 7 p.m. local time in Afghanistan, the United States military used a GBU-43B weapon in Afghanistan. The GBU-43B is a powerful and accurately delivered weapon. We targeted a system of tunnels and caves that ISIS fighters used to move around freely, making it easier for them to target U.S. military advisors and Afghan forces in the area,\u201d White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer  said Thursday about the drop. \u201cThe United States takes the fight against ISIS seriously and in order to defeat the group, we must deny them operational space, which we did.\u201d The bomb was dropped by an MC-130 aircraft, flown by Air Force Special Operations Command, the network said. \u00a0The target was tunnels used by ISIS terrorists in the Achin district of the Nangarhar province of Afghanistan.\u00a0According to Fox News\u2019 Jennifer Griffith, the blast area for the bomb is a mile wide. Gen. John Nicholson , U.S. Forces Commander for Afghanistan, signed off on the use of the bomb, according to the sources. \u201cAs ISIS-K\u2019s losses have mounted, they are using IEDs, bunkers and tunnels to thicken their defense,\u201d General Nicholson said in a statement. \u201cThis is the right munition to reduce these obstacles and maintain the momentum of our offensive against ISIS-K.\u201d The bomb was dropped\u00a0in the region that U.S. Army\u00a0Green Beret\u00a0 Staff Sgt. Mark De Alencar  was killed\u00a0by ISIS terrorists last week. Nangarhar Province sits on the eastern border with Pakistan, which has been a longtime terrorist stronghold. This type of bomb, a GBU-43B, developed during the Iraq War, has never been used in combat until now. The military is doing a damage assessment so casualty figures were not immediately clear. According to CENTCOM and the White House, \u201cU.S. forces took every precaution to avoid civilian casualties with this strike.\u201d President Trump on Thursday praised the dropping of a huge bomb on ISIS strongholds in Afghanistan as \u201ca very, very successful mission.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re very, very proud of our military,\u201d Trump told reporters during a White House event honoring first responders to an interstate bridge collapse in Georgia. \u201cWe are so proud of our military and it was another successful event.\u201d Asked if he personally authorized dropping the bomb \u2014 the largest non-nuclear explosive the US has ever detonated on a battlefield \u2014 Trump replied, \u201cEverybody knows exactly what happened. What I do is authorize our military. We have given them total authorization. That\u2019s why they\u2019ve been so successful lately.\u201d He was also asked if dropping the MOAB would deter North Korea\u2019s belligerence. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it sends a message, it doesn\u2019t make any difference if it does or not. North Korea\u2019s a problem. The problem will be taken care of,\u201d he said. Trump also said that the military has had more success in the last eight weeks than in the eight years of the Obama administration. President Trump during the campaign promised to \u201cbomb the (heck)\u201d out of ISIS, and this escalation could be the first sign of that policy in action.

(Photo:  Twitter / @TheJusticeDept) Jump to... Questions Background Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (Compiled from reports at NY Post and LA Times) \u2013 U.S. Attorney General\u00a0Jeff Sessions has directed federal prosecutors in the states bordering Mexico to crack down on immigrants who repeatedly enter the country illegally. A memorandum made public Tuesday morning orders each of the five federal Southwest border districts \u2014 spanning California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas \u2014 to appoint a \u201cborder security coordinator\u201d to oversee \u201cthe investigation and prosecution\u201d of migrants under the new policy. The crime of improper entry by a migrant is currently a misdemeanor . Under the new policy, it will be prosecuted as a felony  for migrants who already have two such misdemeanor convictions or for those with one conviction if there are aggravating circumstances, such as gang affiliation. In his directive to federal prosecutors, Sessions said felony prosecutions would be recommended for repeat\u00a0illegal immigrants, \u201cespecially where indicators of gang affiliation, a risk to public safety or criminal history are present.\u201d Speaking to a group of Customs and Border Protection agents in his first trip to the border as the nation\u2019s top prosecutor, Sessions said the new policy is\u00a0aimed at preventing drug cartel workers from entering the country. \u201cFor those that continue to seek improper and illegal entry into this country, be forewarned: This is a new era. This is the Trump era,\u201d Sessions said Tuesday in a speech  at the Nogales port of entry in Arizona.\u00a0\u201cThe lawlessness, the abdication of duty to\u200b enforce\u200b\u200b our laws, and the catch-and-release  policies of the past are over\u200b.\u201d Cartels are \u201ccriminal organizations that turn cities and suburbs into war zones, that rape and kill innocent citizens, and who profit by smuggling poison and other human beings across our borders,\u201d  he said. Putting into action many of President Trump\u2019s campaign promises on illegal immigration, Sessions ordered federal prosecutors to pursue charges against illegal immigrants who commit crimes, who illegally and repeatedly cross the border and those with drug cartel and gang affiliations or who have criminal histories. He also said all adult illegal immigrants caught at the border will be detained and ordered a \u201csurge\u201d of 25 immigration judges to detention centers along the border to support the effort. Sessions also said he will add 125 immigration judges over the next two years to \u201creduce\u200b \u200bthe significant\u200b \u200bbacklog in our immigration\u200b courts\u200b \u00a0\u2014 backlogs and\u200b \u200bcatch-and-release policies\u200b \u200bhave\u200b \u200bundermined the effectiveness of our law officers\u2019 work.\u201d \u201cThe battle is far from over. We must follow up on the successes we\u00a0[are having]\u00a0so far, and here on the border, we will do so,\u201d \u200bSessions said. \u200bTrump\u2019s presidency already, he said, has reduced illegal border crossings substantially. From January to February, crossings fell by 40 percent and in March showed a 72 percent drop from the month before, the lowest figure in 17 years, Sessions said. \u200b\u201dThis is no accident, this is what happens when you have a \u200bpresident \u200bwho understands the threat, who is not afraid to \u200bpublicly identify the threat and stand up to it and who makes c\u200blear\u200b to law \u200benforcement \u200bthat the leadersh\u200bi\u200bp of th\u200bei\u200br country finally has their back\u200b -\u200b and tells the whole world the illegality is over\u200b,\u201d he said.\u200b The policy is part of a broader plan to toughen immigration laws and speed deportations, said David Lapan, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security.

(Photo: Alexey Druzhinin/AFP/Getty Images) Jump to... Questions Background Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (Compiled from news reports at London\u2019s Daily Telegraph, The Wall Street Journal and Reuters) \u2013 British Prime Minister Theresa May and U.S. President Donald Trump have agreed that \u201ca window of opportunity\u201d now exists to persuade Russia to break ties with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. A Downing Street spokesman said that when they spoke on Monday evening: The Prime Minister and the president agreed that a window of opportunity now exists in which to persuade Russia that its alliance with Assad is no longer in its strategic interest. They agreed that US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson\u2019s visit to Moscow this week provides an opportunity to make progress towards a solution which will deliver a lasting political settlement. (Tillerson will attempt to\u00a0persuade Russia, Syria\u2019s key ally, to distance itself from the Assad regime.) President Trump also spoke to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and agreed with both European allies \u201con the importance of holding Syrian President Bashar al-Assad accountable,\u201d the\u00a0White House said in a statement. Trump administration officials said a week ago that they had abandoned the goal of forcing Assad to leave power.\u00a0However, Assad\u2019s chemical weapons attack on Idlib province last Tuesday, which left at least 87 people dead including more than 30 children, had a \u201cprofound effect\u201d on the US president and led him to order retaliatory air strikes against an Assad regime air base. Secretary Tillerson arrived in Moscow Tuesday following a meeting\u00a0in Italy of the G7 \u00a0(Group of 7 industrialized nations :\u00a0US, UK, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan). After the meeting, calling\u00a0\u00a0the strike a \u201cgame changer,\u201d British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said support for the Syrian president \u201cwas toxifying the reputation of Russia\u201d and suggested sanctions could be imposed on Moscow if it refused to change course. \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is to give Rex Tillerson the clearest possible mandate  from us as the West, the UK, all our allies here, to say to the Russians \u2018this is your choice: stick with that guy, stick with that tyrant, or work with us to find a better solution\u2019,\u201d Johnson said after meeting Tillerson. Before leaving Italy, Tillerson issued a new U.S. demand for the eventual removal of Mr. Assad, who is blamed by the U.S. and West for the long-running civil war in Syria. \u201cIt is clear to all of us that the reign of the Assad family is coming to an end,\u201d Mr. Tillerson told reporters. \u00a0\u201cWe hope that the Russian government concludes that they have aligned themselves with an unreliable partner in Bashar Al-Assad.\u201d Tillerson said Russia had failed in its role as sponsor of a 2013 deal made by the Obama administration under which Assad promised to give up his chemical arsenal. \u201cThese agreements stipulated Russia as the guarantor of a Syria free of chemical weapons,\u201d Tillerson said. \u201cIt is unclear whether Russia failed to take this obligation seriously and whether Russia has been incompetent. But this distinction doesn\u2019t much matter to the dead. We can\u2019t let this happen again.\u201d U.S. officials said the air strike and renewed pressure from the international community could help Mr. Tillerson make his case to Russia. Reuters reported:\u00a0U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson carried a unified message from world powers to Moscow, denouncing Russian support for Syria and taking up America\u2019s traditional role as leader of the West on behalf of Donald Trump\u2019s administration. Ahead of Mr. Tillerson\u2019s arrival, the Russian Foreign Ministry in a statement blamed the U.S. for pursuing a policy of \u201cAmerican exceptionalism,\u201d that tried to punish Russia economically and limit its influence in international affairs. \u201cRussia, of course, is not going to surrender its legitimate interests and accepts cooperation only on an equal basis, which is not to everyone\u2019s liking in Washington,\u201d the statement read. \u201cWe, however, have always been and remain open to the most frank dialogue with the U.S. on any issues on the bilateral and international agenda and for joint work in areas where the goals coincide.\u201d Although the State Department began planning Mr. Tillerson\u2019s trip before the deadly chemical weapons attack last week in Syria, that event and the U.S. response have fueled tensions between Moscow and Washington and have raised the stakes of the visit. \u201cThe most important factor for Putin is not loyalty to Assad, but stability of the Syrian regime, which enables Russia to hold a significant geopolitical position in the Middle East. He could conceivably achieve that in a post-Assad scenario. So there is room for negotiation on that point,\u201d said Matthew Rojansky, a Russia expert at the Wilson Center in Washington. Secretary Tillerson\u2019s visit beginning Tuesday is his first official trip to Moscow, but had met with Putin when\u00a0CEO of Exxon Mobil, which has gigantic projects in Russia. He was awarded Russia\u2019s \u201cOrder of Friendship\u201d by Putin in 2013. Tillerson is set to meet Russia\u2019s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov. A Kremlin spokesman said Monday that a meeting between Mr. Tillerson and Mr. Putin wasn\u2019t on the Russian leader\u2019s calendar, despite earlier U.S. expectations of such a session. Current and former officials who have planned such trips said it isn\u2019t unusual for a meeting with Mr. Putin to remain uncertain until the last minute, but that usually the Russian leader grants an audience to the U.S. Secretary of State. In their phone call, Prime Minister May and President Trump also \u201cdiscussed the broader Middle East, including the threat posed by Iran throughout the region.\u201d \u201cThe Prime Minister and president also stressed the importance of the international community, including China, putting pressure on North Korea to constrain the threat it poses,\u201d the statement said.

Free Answers \u2014 Sign-up here  to receive a daily email with answers. Background The following is an editorial by NY Post Editorial Board, April 10, 2017: \u201cSurprise: Trump\u2019s calm, competent global leadership\u201d: President Trump is emerging from his first overseas crisis looking calm and competent, with his foreign-policy and national-security teams hitting on all cylinders. Surprise! His airstrike against Bashar al-Assad\u2019s forces in Syria won the support of 78 US senators, including 30 Democrats \u2014 albeit with some qualifications. The fact that Trump executed what came off as a rapid turnaround on his Syria policy in the wake of a war crime indicates he\u2019s not locked into preconceived notions or policies: He\u2019s adjusting to reality as it develops. Yes, Trump lacks the kind of grand foreign-policy doctrine pushed by the last two presidents \u2014 but that\u2019s not such a bad thing. In a world full of unknown and unpredictable factors, he\u2019s prepared to act on the basis of actual realities, unbeholden to an agenda of aggressive nation-building or appeasement. Which is why the White House is taking pains to stress that the Syria strike is not a preliminary to an anti-Assad military campaign, or a policy of active regime change. Yet, at the same time, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster are also making it clear that the United States \u201ccannot stand idly by\u201d if Assad continues to use chemical weapons. That\u2019s a tough but cautious line, awaiting developments and keeping all US options open. It\u2019s also putting the lie to fears that the president would be a puppet of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Indeed, the opposite has proved true: Relations between Moscow and Washington are seriously strained, especially now that the administration says it\u2019s convinced Putin knew in advance about Assad\u2019s gas attack. And the criticism from Tillerson, now in Russia (where Putin is refusing to meet with him), and UN Ambassador Nikki Haley has been tough and unremitting.

The new justice took two legally required oaths at separate ceremonies.  The first was administered by Chief Justice John Roberts in private at the Supreme Court. Later, fellow Justice Anthony Kennedy administered an oath during a ceremony at the White House Rose Garden (above) with President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence in attendance.

Questions Background Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by Marisa Schultz, New York Post) WASHINGTON \u2014 Neil Gorsuch was sworn in as the 101st associate justice of the Supreme Court on Monday, restoring a conservative balance to the high court. Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. administered the constitutional oath of office to Gorsuch in a private ceremony at the Supreme Court. A public ceremony followed at the White House, where Justice Anthony Kennedy administered the judicial oath. \u201cTo the American people, I am humbled by the trust placed in me today,\u201d Gorsuch said, with his wife Louise and the Republican president standing behind him. \u201cI will never forget that to whom much is given, much will be expected. And I promise you that I will do all my powers permit to be a faithful servant of the Constitution and laws of this great nation.\u201d Gorsuch will be the first justice to serve alongside a fellow justice \u2014 Kennedy \u2014 for whom he was a clerk. Gorsuch will not have much time to get comfortable with his new job. He\u2019ll first appear on the bench Monday to finish out the current session of the Supreme Court, which runs through April. He could be the deciding vote on a religious freedom case to come before the court April 19 \u2013 Trinity Lutheran Church v. Comer. The church in Columbia, Missouri, applied for a state grant for nonprofits wanting to upgrade playgrounds. The church was denied the funds, citing a provision in the state constitution that bars public aid going to churches. The case has been long delayed and Gorsuch is seen as a likely favorable vote for the church, testing whether religious institutions have equal access to government programs. The court had been operating with a 4-4 split of Democrat- and Republican-appointed justices since February 2016, following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia \u00a0[although Republican-appointed Justice Anthony Kennedy has been the   [Gorsuch, 49, a fourth-generation Coloradan who sat on the US Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit in Denver, will restore the swing vote  on many of the Court\u2019s 5\u20134 decisions]. ideological balance  that existed before Scalia\u2019s sudden death in February 2016 left a gaping vacancy. Gorsuch has praised the late Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s dedication to \u201c textualism \u00a0(originalism),\u201d or the interpretation of laws based on the actual text rather than trying to decipher the \u201cintent\u201d of lawmakers or other potential consequences. Gorsuch has been\u00a0described\u00a0as a constitutionalist \u00a0who\u00a0adheres to \u201c originalism  (also known as textualism)\u201d when interpreting the U.S. Constitution. \u2026Gorsuch has also routinely ruled\u00a0in favor of religious liberty, as Business Insider\u00a0noted\u00a0\u2014 siding\u00a0with Hobby Lobby and Little Sisters of the Poor who said\u00a0Obamacare\u2019s contraceptive mandate violated their religion because it\u00a0required them to pay for abortifacients like the Morning After pill. He wrote that federal courts should give strong consideration to religious beliefs:\u00a0\u201cIt is not for secular courts to rewrite the religious complaint of a faithful adherent, or to decide whether a religious teaching about complicity imposes \u2018too much\u2019 moral disapproval on those only \u2018indirectly\u2019 assisting wrongful conduct,\u201d he noted in a concurring opinion. The Harvard grad is a conservative Republican and a champion of religious liberty known for his easy to understand writing style. Gorsuch has\u00a0written against euthanasia\u00a0and assisted suicide, the latter of which Colorado\u00a0legalized\u00a0last November. \u201cAll human beings are intrinsically valuable and the intentional taking of human life by private persons is always wrong,\u201d he wrote in\u00a0his 2006 book\u00a0\u201cThe Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia.\u201d Gorsuch attended Columbia, Harvard Law School and Oxford, and he was a partner with the Washington law firm Kellogg Huber Hansen Todd Evans & Fige.\u00a0He also clerked for Supreme Court Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy. The Senate unanimously voted to confirm Gorsuch to the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in 2006. In a 2005 article in the conservative National Review, Gorsuch argued that \u201cAmerican liberals have become addicted to the courtroom, relying on judges and lawyers rather than elected leaders and the ballot box, as the primary means of effecting their social agenda.\u201d A study led by Mercer University law professor Jeremy Kidd concluded that Gorsuch was the second-most similar to Scalia of the 21 prospective justices on a list Trump released during the presidential campaign.] Compiled from two New York Post articles \u2013 April 10, 2017, and \u201c Trump announces Supreme Court pick \u201d\u00a0on February 27, 2017. Questions 1. What will Neil Gorsuch be the first Supreme Court Justice to do? 2. When will Justice Gorsuch begin his tenure on the Supreme Court? 3. Why could Justice Gorsuch be the deciding vote on a religious freedom case to come before the court on April 19? 4. What type of judge is Neil Gorsuch? 5. What is textualism (originalism)? 6. Read the \u201cBackground\u201d below the questions. Consider the following: Democrats/progressives/liberals say they are against Judge Gorsuch because he is viewed as a conservative and they believe he will make his court rulings based on his personal philosophies. Republicans/conservatives say they support Judge Gorsuch because he is a constitutionalist and will not make his court rulings based on his personal philosophies, but rather on what the constitution says. They support Constitutionalists (the late) Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, whose strict interpretation of the Constitution has at times led them to make \u201cliberal\u201d rulings, not based on what they personally believed on the issue, but what they believed the Constitution says. This can be confusing, and possibly boring:) to some of you, but it is important that you understand the issue in order to be a good citizen and an educated voter.

Background On the Role of Judges: Judges are like umpires in baseball or referees in football or basketball. Their role is to see that the rules of court procedures are followed by both sides. Like the ump, they call \u2018em as they see \u2018em, according to the facts and law-without regard to which side is popular (no home field advantage), without regard to who is \u201cfavored,\u201d without regard for what the spectators want, and without regard to whether the judge agrees with the law.\u00a0(from the American Bar Asociation) \u201cThe role of a judge is to be a neutral interpreter of already established law, not legislator of new law or social policy.\u00a0 A judge can have his or her own opinions, even strong ones, and still read the law neutrally.\u00a0 Fundamentally, judges are expected to not bring their personal politics and philosophies to the bench. Judges are expected to read the law in its clear intent and apply it without regard to result. Changing the law should be left to the people and their legislators.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Sean Rushton, Committee for Justice Executive Director,\u00a0from\u00a0the WashingtonPost .com. \u201cOne of the big confusions in the\u2026Senate fight over the confirmation of judicial nominees is that this is an issue about \u2018liberal\u2019 judges versus \u2018conservative\u2019 judges.\u00a0 The vastly more important issue is whether people who go into court should expect their cases to be decided on the basis of the law or on the basis of the particular judge\u2019s own philosophy\u2026Liberals have rooted for judicial activism because this activism has favored liberal causes and liberal views on such issues as abortion, the death penalty, gay marriage, and racial quotas.\u00a0 But activism can be used by any judge for any purpose.\u201d\u00a0Thomas Sowell, Hoover Institution (from the\u00a0New York Post editorial board, Feb. 14, 2016) Scalia was the most eloquent and passionate advocate of \u201coriginal understanding\u201d \u2014 the notion that judges should decide a law\u2019s constitutionality by its actual words, not the \u201cintent\u201d behind it or the needs of society: \u201cIt is not supposed to be our judgment as to what is the socially desirable answer to all of these questions,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s supposed to be the judgment of Congress.\u201d Indeed, he wrote in one of his many memorable opinions: \u201cA system of government that makes the People subordinate to a committee of nine unelected lawyers does not deserve to be called a democracy.\u201d He believed not in a \u201cliving\u201d Constitution, subject to \u201cthe passions of the moment that may cause individual liberties to be disregarded,\u201d but an \u201cenduring\u201d one, dedicated to federalism and the separation of powers. On the types of cases the Supreme Court hears: Approximately 7,500 cases are sent to the Supreme Court each year. Out of these, only 80 to 100 are actually heard by the Supreme Court. When a case comes to the Supreme Court, several things happen. First, the Justices get together to decide if a case is worthy of being brought before the Court. In other words, does the case really involve Constitutional or federal law ? Secondly, a Supreme Court ruling can affect the outcome of hundreds or even thousands of cases in lower courts around the country. Therefore, the Court tries to use this enormous power only when a case presents a pressing constitutional issue . \u2026 (from bensguide.gpo.gov) Resources Watch Neil Gorsuch take the Judicial Oath of Office: https://www.studentnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Neil-Gorsuch-takes-the-Judicial-Oath-As-Supreme-Court-Justice.mp4 Recent Daily News Articles Veterans Day 2017: Vets Plan To Boycott NFL Games On Sunday November 10, 2017 EPA approves bacteria-infected insects to kill mosquitoes November 9, 2017 Pa. officials still mostly mum on noncitizens registered to vote November 8, 2017 Tuesday\u2019s World News #1 \u2013 Lebanon November 7, 2017 US deserter Bowe Bergdahl spared prison time November 6, 2017 Get the App Follow Us Elsewhere About  \u00a0\u2014 Site Overview  \u00a0\u2014 Contact Us  \u00a0\u2014 Donate Launched in 2005, StudentNewsDaily.com is a 501(c)3 non-profit educational website.

Jump to... Questions Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by David Morgan, Reuters)\u00a0WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0U.S. military strikes against Syria over its alleged use of chemical weapons are a warning to other nations, including North Korea, that \u201ca response is likely\u201d if they pose a danger, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson  said on Sunday. As a U.S. Navy strike group headed toward the Korean Peninsula, Tillerson said China agrees that action is necessary to address North Korea\u2019s nuclear arsenal, following last week\u2019s meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Asked if Friday\u2019s strikes against Syria were a message to North Korea, Tillerson told ABC\u2019s This Week: \u201cThe message that any nation can take is, \u2018If you violate international norms, if you violate international agreements, if you fail to live up to commitments, if you become a threat to others, at some point a response is likely to be undertaken.'\u201d \u201cIn terms of North Korea,\u201d he added, \u201cwe\u2019ve been very clear that our objective is a denuclearized Korea peninsula.\u201d In a separate interview, Tillerson told CBS\u2019 Face the Nation: \u201cPresident Xi clearly understands, and I think agrees, that the situation has intensified and has reached a certain level of threat that action has to be taken.\u201d President Trump will soon review options for removing the \u201cthreat\u201d posed by North Korean missiles, White House national security adviser H.R. McMaster  said on Sunday. North Korean officials, including leader Kim Jong Un, have repeatedly indicated an intercontinental ballistic missile test or something similar could be coming, possibly as soon as April 15, the 105th birthday of North Korea\u2019s founding president and celebrated annually as \u201cthe Day of the Sun.\u201d Reuters was first to report on Saturday that the Navy strike group USS Carl Vinson , whose flagship is a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier of that name, will make its way toward the Korean peninsula from Singapore as a show of force after Pyongyang tested a liquid-fueled Scud missile this month. \u201cIt\u2019s prudent to do it, isn\u2019t it?\u201d McMaster said of the deployment on Fox News Sunday. \u201cThis is a rogue regime that is now a nuclear-capable regime, and President Xi and President Trump agreed that that is unacceptable, that what must happen is the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,\u201d he said. A U.S. national security review of options on North Korea include economic and military measures. But they lean more toward sanctions  and increased pressure on Beijing to rein in its neighbor.

He said the attack \"crosses many, many lines,\" an allusion to his predecessor Barack Obama's threat to topple Assad with air strikes if he used such weapons, which he did not carry through on. Jump to... Questions Background Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by Jeff Mason and Tom Perry, Reuters)\u00a0 WASHINGTON/BEIRUT \u2014\u00a0U.S. President Donald Trump accused Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s  government of going with a poison gas attack on civilians and said his attitude toward Syria and Assad had changed, but \u201cbeyond a red line\u201d . gave no indication of how he would respond President Trump said the attack, which killed at least 70 people, many of them children, \u201ccrosses many, many lines,\u201d an allusion to his predecessor Barack Obama\u2019s threat to topple Assad with air strikes if he used such weapons. (Assad continued to use chemical weapons; President Obama failed to follow through on his threat.) \u00a0 Mr. Trump\u2019s accusations against Assad put him directly at odds with Moscow, the Syrian president\u2019s principal backer. \u201cI will tell you, what happened yesterday is unacceptable to me,\u201d President Trump told reporters at a news conference with Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah on Wednesday. \u201cAnd I will tell you, it\u2019s already happened that my attitude toward Syria and Assad has changed very much,\u201d though when asked at an earlier meeting whether he was formulating a new policy on Syria, Mr. Trump said: \u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d Vice President Mike Pence , when asked whether it was time to renew the call for Assad to be ousted and safe zones be established, told Fox News: \u201cBut let me be clear, all options are on the table,\u201d . without elaborating U.S. officials rejected Russia\u2019s assertion that Syrian rebels were to blame for the attack. President Trump\u2019s comments, which came just a few days after Washington said it was no longer focused on making Assad leave power, suggested a clash between the Kremlin and Mr. Trump\u2019s White House after initial signals of warmer ties. President Trump did not mention Russia in his comments on Wednesday but Secretary of State Rex Tillerson  said it was time for Russia to think carefully about its support for Assad. Vice President Pence said the time had come for Moscow to \u201ckeep the word that they made to see to the elimination of chemical weapons so that they no longer threaten the people in that country.\u201d Western countries, including the United States, blamed Assad\u2019s armed forces for the worst chemical attack in Syria for more than four years. U.S. intelligence officials, based on a preliminary assessment, said the deaths were most likely caused by dropped by Syrian aircraft on the town of Khan Sheikhoun on Tuesday. A senior State Department official said Washington had not yet ascertained it was sarin. sarin nerve gas Moscow offered an alternative explanation that would shield Assad: that the poison gas belonged to rebels and had leaked from an insurgent weapons depot hit by Syrian bombs. A senior White House official , speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Russian explanation was not credible. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe it,\u201d the official said. Following the attack, the United States, Britain and France have proposed a draft U.N. Security Council resolution that would condemn the attack; the Russian Foreign Ministry called it \u201cunacceptable\u201d and said it was based on \u201cfake information.\u201d\u00a0Moscow has proposed its own draft. The U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley , issued what appeared to be a threat of unilateral action if Security Council members could not agree. \u201cWhen the United Nations consistently fails in its duty to act collectively, there are times in the life of states that we are compelled to take our own action,\u201d she told the council, . without elaborating President Trump described the attack as \u201chorrible\u201d and \u201cunspeakable.\u201d He faulted President Obama for failing to carry through on his \u201cred line\u201d threat and when asked if he had responsibility to respond to the attack, said: \u201cI now have responsibility.\u201d The French charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) \u00a0said one of its hospitals in Syria had treated patients \u201cwith symptoms \u2013 dilated pupils, muscle spasms, involuntary defecation \u2013 consistent with exposure to neuro-toxic agents such as sarin\u201d. The World Health Organization  also said the symptoms were consistent with exposure to a nerve agent. Video uploaded to social media showed civilians sprawled on the ground, some in convulsions, others lifeless. Rescue workers hose down the limp bodies of small children, trying to wash away chemicals. People wail and pound on the chests of victims. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about war crimes,\u201d French U.N. Ambassador Francois Delattre told reporters in New York. The incident is the first time U.S. intelligence officials have accused Assad of using sarin since 2013, when hundreds of people died in an attack on a Damascus suburb. At that time, Washington said Assad had crossed a \u201cred line\u201d set by then-President Obama. President Obama threatened an air campaign to topple Assad but called it off at the last minute when the Syrian leader agreed to give up his chemical arsenal under a deal brokered by Moscow, a decision which Mr. Trump has long said proved Mr. Obama\u2019s weakness.

Background President Obama on Bashar Assad\u2019s use of chemical weapons: On August 20, 2012, President Obama stated that the use of chemical weapons by Syria\u2019s President Asad would be a \u201cred line for us.\u201d He was specifically answering a question whether he would ever \u201cenvision using U.S. military\u201d force in Syria. Obama\u2019s \u201cred line\u201d wasn\u2019t an offhand remark. The president repeated the line several times and his staff used in official communications with the U.S. Congress: Because of our concern about the deteriorating situation in Syria, the president has made it clear that the use of chemical weapons \u2014 or transfer of chemical weapons to terrorist groups \u2014 is a red line for the United States of America. The Obama administration has communicated that message publicly and privately to governments around the world, including the Assad regime. Obama\u2019s \u201cred line\u201d made headlines around the globe. Every one believed that if Syria\u2019 s dictator Bashir al-Assad used chemical weapons, Obama would order military strikes.  [After the President\u2019s remarks, Assad]\u00a0started with a small, deniable use of chemical weapons. The president\u2019s [aides]\u00a0quickly said the evidence was inconclusive, speculative and even dangerous. So progressively larger chemical weapons attacks followed\u2014until U.N. inspectors and other international observers found the evidence to be so overwhelming that it couldn\u2019t be denied any longer. The President\u2026.denied drawing any red line and claimed it was the responsibility of Congress or the international community to do something.

Questions Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by Peter Valdes-Dapena, CNN Money) \u2013\u00a0When an enemy is looking for you, especially an enemy with night vision technology, you want to keep cool and quiet. That\u2019s why General Motors and the United States Army developed the hydrogen-powered Chevrolet ZH2 off-road truck . The 6\u00bd-foot tall ZH2 doesn\u2019t burn hydrogen. Instead, it pumps hydrogen into a fuel cell where it\u2019s combined with oxygen. That creates water (H2O) while, at same time, releasing a stream of electrical energy to power the vehicle. The truck was developed by GM\u00a0in cooperation with the United States Army\u2019s Tank Automotive Research and Development Center (TARDEC) , headquartered near Detroit. Underneath its camouflaged Kevlar-reinforced carbon fiber skin, the ZH2 is based on the GM\u2019s Chevrolet Colorado mid-sized pickup. The big ZH2 is very quiet, but it\u2019s not completely silent. When it starts up there is a whoosh of air being sucked in. When it\u2019s moving, as it did recently through an off-road course at GM\u2019s Milford Proving Grounds , there is some noise from the tires, suspension, electric motors and splashing mud. But, compared to a rumbling diesel truck, it\u2019s nearly silent. In military parlance, there is minimal \u201caccoustic signature.\u201d Since the truck isn\u2019t burning any fuel, it doesn\u2019t give off much heat that could be picked up by heat-sensing night vision cameras. In other words, there\u2019s not much of a either. \u201cthermal signature\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not doing it in this vehicle, but it is possible for us to take the exhaust gas from the engine, or the fuel cell, and actually create potable water,\u201d said Brian Butrico, with the U.S. Army\u2019s Research and Development and Engineering Command . \u201cThe soldiers can actually create their own drinking water as they\u2019re operating the vehicle.\u201d Refueling the truck will be different from refueling a truck with liquid fuel. The ZH2\u2019s thick-walled storage tank \u2014 GM engineers went through 38 saw blades trying to cut one in half for a display \u2014 is filled with compressed hydrogen gas. Although hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe, it doesn\u2019t ordinarily exist as a free-floating gas. It has to be extracted from substances that contain hydrogen, like water or hydrocarbon fuels. That can be done using portable devices that can run on solar or battery power or that plug in to a local electrical grid. \u201cOur machine will take JP8, which is the common military fuel, and convert it right into hydrogen,\u201d said Butrico. Where ever it goes, it can make its own fuel. Hydrogen gas could also be made from any sources on hand wherever the truck happens to be, he said. It takes about 3 minutes to fill the fuel tank, according to GM. With five to six kilograms of hydrogen \u2014 about 12 pounds \u2014 the ZH2 can go about 200 to 300 miles, said Charlie Freese, executive director for GM\u2019s fuel cell business. It could go as far as 400 miles with a hydrogen tank optimized for longer range, he explained. Prior to creating the ZH2, GM and the military had been experimenting with\u00a0hydrogen fuel cells in strictly road-going crossover SUVs. Today, Toyota, Honda and Hyundai have fuel cell vehicles available for lease or sale to the general public in California. First published April 3, 2017. Reprinted here for educational purposes only.

Questions Background Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by Alex Dobuzinskis, Reuters)\u00a0\u00a0LOS ANGELES \u2013 Federal immigration agents have arrested illegal immigrants at California courthouses because local authorities have blocked\u00a0apprehensions at jails, the Trump administration\u2019s top two law enforcement officials told the state\u2019s chief justice, who had requested a halt to the practice. In a letter to Chief Justice Tani Cantil-Sakauye made public on Friday, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions  and Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly  gave no indication that agents would stop the arrests. Sessions and Kelly criticized California officials for limiting the cooperation of state and local law enforcement officers with U.S. agents, preventing them from going to jails to pick up illegal immigrants arrested for other crimes [which is usually done].\u00a0The attorney general and DHS secretary criticized California and its jurisdictions for having policies of non-cooperation  with ICE  [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement] \u2014 blaming those policies for the courthouse arrests. \u201cSome jurisdictions, including the State of California and many of its largest counties and cities, have enacted statutes and ordinances designed to specifically prohibit or hinder ICE from enforcing immigration law by prohibiting communication with ICE, and denying requests by ICE officers and agents to enter prisons and jails to make arrests,\u201d Sessions and Kelly wrote. \u201cAs a result, ICE officers and agents are required to locate and arrest these aliens in public places, rather than in secure jail facilities,\u201d Sessions and Kelly wrote in the letter dated on Wednesday, using the acronym for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Kelly, whose Department of Homeland Security includes ICE, and Sessions, who as attorney general heads the Justice Department, are members of President Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet. Since taking office in January, Mr. Trump has widened the net for illegal immigrants to be detained and removed from the country, in keeping with his White House campaign promise. Immigrant rights groups say federal agents have entered courthouses with increased frequency this year, including in California, Massachusetts, Maryland and Texas. California law enforcement officers, including in Los Angeles and San Francisco, decline requests from ICE agents to hold illegal immigrants past their release dates in local jails so they can be transferred to federal custody. The stance of these law enforcement officials follows orders\u00a0from the state\u2019s two most recent Democratic attorneys general. These and other \u201csanctuary\u201d jurisdictions that opt not to cooperate with federal immigration agents / refuse to obey federal law \u00a0have [been opposed by the majority of Americans]. Last Monday, Sessions threatened to withhold millions of dollars in U.S. funding for cities that fail to assist immigration authorities / refuse to uphold the law . In their letter, Kelly and Sessions said agents make arrests at courthouses rather than other public places in part because visitors are screened for weapons before entering, as they are at jails. They were responding to a letter sent two weeks ago by Cantil-Sakauye, who asked the two Cabinet officials to stop immigration agents from arresting illegal\u00a0immigrants inside California courthouses. [\u201cOur courthouses serve as a vital forum for ensuring access to justice and protecting public safety,\u201d] Cantil-Sakauye wrote in her letter earlier this month. \u201cCourthouses should not be used as bait in the necessary enforcement of our country\u2019s immigration laws.\u201d The presence of immigration agents in courthouses in the nation\u2019s most populous state could undermine public trust in its judicial system, she said. Her letter went on to say that immigration agents were \u201cstalking undocumented immigrants\u201d at courthouses, language that drew a sharp rebuke from Sessions and Kelly. They said the use of the word \u201cstalking\u201d suggested criminal conduct. They said that was unwarranted because agents have full authority to arrest illegal immigrants \u2013 [that\u00a0ICE is constitutionally and lawfully authorized to arrest anyone with probable cause.]. Questions 1. The first paragraph of a news article should answer the questions who, what, where and when. List the who, what, where and when of this news item. (NOTE: The remainder of a news article provides details on the why and/or how.) 2. a) What is the role of the U.S. Attorney General? b) What is the role of the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security? c) Name the current U.S. Attorney General and DHS Secretary. 3. a) What did the Chief Justice of California\u2019s Supreme Court ask Sessions and Kelly to do in a letter? b) Why have ICE agents begun arresting illegal immigrants at California courthouses? Be specific \u2014 In a letter to the Chief Justice made public on Friday, for what reasons did\u00a0Sessions and Kelly criticize California officials? 4. a) For what reason did the Chief Justice of California\u2019s Supreme Court ask Sessions and Kelly to stop immigration agents from arresting illegal immigrants inside California courthouses? b) How did they reply to this concern? 5. How did the Attorney General and DHS Secretary respond to the Chief Justice\u2019s accusation that ICE agents were \u201cstalking undocumented immigrants\u201d at courthouses? 6. The Hill reported on February 27: A survey from Harvard\u2013Harris Poll found that 80 percent of voters say local authorities should have to comply with the law by reporting to federal agents the illegal immigrants they come into contact with. Hundreds of cities across the nation \u2014 many with Democratic mayors or city councils \u2014 are refusing to do so [and have declared their cities to be \u201csanctuary cities,\u201d which are cities which permit residence by illegal immigrants to help them avoid deportation.]. President Trump has signed an executive order directing Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly to find ways to [cut] federal funding to these sanctuary cities. A Reuters analysis found the top 10 sanctuary cities in the U.S. receive $2.27 billion in federal funding for programs ranging from public health services to early childhood education. The Harvard\u2013Harris Poll survey found strong support for an overhaul of the nation\u2019s immigration laws, with 77 percent saying they support comprehensive immigration reform against only 23 percent who oppose. \u201cWhile there is broad support for comprehensive immigration reform, there is overwhelming opposition to sanctuary cities,\u201d said Harvard\u2013Harris co-director Mark Penn. \u201cThe public wants honest immigrants treated fairly and those who commit crimes deported and that\u2019s very clear from the data.\u201d The finding is one of several in the survey that show President Trump has support for some of the\u2026immigration proposals [strongly opposed by progressives] that were a hallmark of his campaign.

Jump to... Questions Background Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by Steve Holland, Reuters) \u2013 U.S. President Donald Trump moved to reset U.S. relations with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi  on Monday after the prior Obama administration\u2019s strained ties, giving him firm backing and vowing to work together to fight Islamic militants. \u201cI just want to let everybody know in case there was any doubt that we are very much behind President Sisi. He\u2019s done a fantastic job in a very difficult situation. We are very much behind Egypt and the people of Egypt,\u201d Trump said in an Oval Office meeting with the Egyptian leader. The trip was Sisi\u2019s first official U.S. visit since being elected president in 2014. Trump\u2019s predecessor, Barack Obama, never extended an invitation. [Instead, Obama\u2019s\u00a0State Department officials\u00a0met in Washington with Egyptian members of the Muslim Brotherhood.] Obama froze aid to Egypt for two years after Sisi, then a general, overthrew President Mohamed Mursi in mid-2013 after mass protests against Mursi\u2019s rule. Mursi, a Muslim Brotherhood member, had been elected the previous year.  [Former Attorney General Michael Mukasey wrote  in 2015: \u00a0\u201cIn June 2013, 30 million Egyptians \u2013 a third of the country \u2013 took to the streets to protest the Muslim Brotherhood rule of President Mohammed Morsi. It was the largest peaceful demonstration in world history. Then-Gen. Sisi, as defense minister, led a coalition of military, religious, judicial and political leaders to force out Morsi, who\u2019d been freely and fairly elected a year before, because the constitution had no provision for impeachment. What brought the people into the streets and Sisi to the fore was the Muslim Brotherhood\u2019s gradual but relentless tightening of its hold on power and its Islamification of daily life, with the restriction of women, near-collapse of the economy and persecution of religious minorities, notably Copts (Coptic Christians)  \u2013 ills that have marked Islamist rule elsewhere, notably in Turkey.\u00a0Some even feared the Muslim Brotherhood planned to suspend the constitution and install an Iran-style theocracy.] The one-on-one meeting between Trump and Sisi on Monday, followed by a separate gathering with top aides, showed how intent the new U.S. president is on rebooting the bilateral relationship and building on the strong connection the two presidents established when they first met in New York last September. \u201cI just want to say to, Mr. President, that you have a great friend and ally in the United States, and in me,\u201d Trump said. Sisi said he appreciated that Trump has been \u201cstanding very strong \u2026 to counter this evil ideology.\u201d While Trump noted the United States and Egypt \u201chave a few things\u201d they do not agree on, he made no public airing of U.S. concerns about human rights in Egypt. \u2026Human rights groups claim\u00a0that Sisi\u2019s government has detained at least 40,000 political prisoners. [Many are members of the Muslim Brotherhood.] Egypt has long been one of Washington\u2019s closest allies in the Middle East, receiving $1.3 billion in U.S. military aid annually. It is fighting an Islamist insurgency in Sinai in which hundreds of Egyptian soldiers and police have been killed. A U.S. official said Sisi would find a White House ready to soften U.S. criticism of Egypt on human rights and to work on counter-terrorism but unwilling to provide additional aid to the most populous Arab nation. \u2026 \u201cHe\u2019s going to be disappointed because he wants more assistance and he\u2019s not going to get it,\u201d the official [noted], saying it was not yet clear whether Egypt would escape a cut in its foreign aid as part of the Trump administration\u2019s plan to cut the overall State Department budget by 28.7 percent. USA Today also reported: \u201cThe [meeting]\u00a0with Sisi \u00a0began a busy foreign policy week for Trump.\u00a0On Wednesday, Trump greets King Abdullah II of Jordan at the White House. On Friday\u00a0he will hold\u00a0a two-day summit with China President Xi Jinping at [his] Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla.\u201d (Additional reporting by Arshad Mohammed, Ayesha Rascoe, Roberta Rampton and Jeff Mason; Editing by James Dalgleish) Reprinted here for educational purposes only.

School officials handed out suspension notices to 500 students last Monday, March 27, as part of a crackdown by the school\u2019s new principal. About 1,100 students are enrolled at\u00a0the school. At least 100 of the students served one-day suspensions on Tuesday\u2026. The disciplinary fates of the other students remain unknown as school officials continue to work with parents to confirm\u00a0whether some of the absences were excused. School officials said many parents were able to provide documentation to clear up their students\u2019 records. School officials met with parents en masse  after school Wednesday to explain the new expectations at the school, which has long struggled with poor test scores and a low graduation rate. \u2026 The school\u2019s tough stance against tardiness and unexcused absences was launched by the , who said she could not improve academic achievement there if students don\u2019t show up. principal, Lisa Love \u201cThe problem I\u2019ve noticed here as principal is that students are coming to school but they are not going to classes when they get here,\u201d said Love, who began leading the school at the end of January. \u201cMany parents send their kids to school and they\u2019re thinking they\u2019re going to class. I needed to reach out because of the enormous number not going to class.\u201d Instead of reporting to class, students congregate in hallways, restrooms, gymnasiums and other nooks and corners of the expansive school building, Love said. Love said she needed to do something \u201cradical\u201d to get the attention of students, parents and the community. \u201cIf you\u2019re not in class, all you\u2019re here to do then is to wreak havoc upon the school and disrupt the work that we are trying to do here,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s to focus on student achievement.\u201d But at least one parent questioned the wisdom of preventing students from attending class as punishment for missing class. \u201cWhat does that teach them?\u201d said , whose daughter was threatened with suspension [for having too many unexcused absences]. \u201cThey\u2019ve got senior projects to do.\u201d Shanelle Franklin said they drew the line for excessive absences for students who missed at least 35 classes in the last marking period without providing proper documentation. Each marking period covers 45 days, or nine weeks. The number of missed-classes that triggered the suspension notice amounts to a week\u2019s worth of unexcused absences, since students have seven classes each day. Assistant Principal Keith Edmonds \u2026School officials began notifying parents of the roughly 500 students that they would be serving a one-day suspension. \u00a0Word quickly spread, Edmonds said, and many parents hurried\u00a0to the school to provide proper documentation for absences, avoiding the suspension penalty. Going forward, students who continue to rack up unexcused absences may miss the prom or graduation ceremonies, Edmonds said. Students with more than 15 unexcused absences can\u2019t go to the prom. Parents who are concerned about their child\u2019s status should contact the high school before purchasing expensive items for the event, Love said. Although the suspensions could be construed as \u201cnegative,\u201d Love said she hoped to translated the situation\u00a0into a positive by using the opportunity to connect with parents. She and other school officials\u00a0also plan to meet parents by hosting meetings\u2026next month. \u00a0[The school plans on working more closely with parents, and within the next month, plans on visiting neighborhoods and individual homes.] \u201cThis was a hard decision for me to make,\u201d Love said of the suspensions, \u201cbut I had to get the attention of the community to let them know that we are here. And we\u2019re about to do some wonderful things for students and the community and we want this to be a school that everyone is proud of. And this was probably the eye opener we needed to make that happen.\u201d The school, whose standardized test scores and graduation rates are among the lowest in the state, needs \u201cradical\u201d change, Love said. It\u2019s a feeling echoed by school district Superintendent Dr. Sybil Knight-Burney , and one of the reasons why Love was hired.\u00a0Knight-Burney said the mass suspensions represented\u00a0a \u201cwake-up call\u201d to the community. \u201cIn order for us to get different results, we have to do something different,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can\u2019t do the same ol\u2019 same ol\u2019 and then complain about it when we\u2019re getting the same ol\u2019 results.\u201d Last year\u2019s Keystone test scores \u00a0showed 7.3 percent of Harrisburg High School students performed as proficient  in biology; 11.7 percent in algebra and 28.8 in literature. The state averages for those subjects, meanwhile, were 64.5 percent, 59 percent and 72.89 percent. The school\u2019s graduation rate increased to 52.78 percent in 2015, but still fell short of the statewide average of 84.75. Reprinted here for educational purposes only.

Jump to... Questions Background Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (Compiled from LA Times , RT, NBCSanDiego and Daily Caller) \u2013\u00a0Federal agents in San Diego have arrested the attorney general for the Mexican state of Nayarit. He was indicted  on charges of conspiracy  to smuggle, manufacture and distribute heroin, methamphetamine, marijuana and cocaine into the U.S. Edgar Veytia , 46, was detained Monday at the U.S. border in San Diego on an indictment handed down by a grand jury in New York, Ralph DeSio, a spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said Wednesday. The indictment was filed March 2 in the Eastern District of New York \u2014 the same jurisdiction where federal prosecutors have charged Sinaloa cartel commander Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n \u2014 and a U.S. magistrate judge in Brooklyn unsealed the charging papers on Tuesday (March 28). As attorney general, Veytia is the top law enforcement official in Nayarit, a state in western Mexico between the cities of Mazatl\u00e1n and Puerto Vallarta. The indictment accuses Veytia of conspiring to manufacture and distribute illicit drugs and import them into the U.S. from 2013 \u2014 the year he became attorney general \u2014 until February of this year. During that same time, Veytia allegedly knew of and would attempt illegal importation of those drugs outside the U.S. as well. Court papers refer to Veytia by a range of aliases, including Diablo. Federal officials did not release additional details about the inquiry except that it involved agents from the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration and the Department of Homeland Security. Mexican media reported allegations of ties between Veytia and the Jalisco New Generation cartel . In 2011, Veytia was the target of an unsuccessful assassination attempt later linked to those affiliated with El Chapo\u2019s Sinaloa cartel , local media reported. Jalisco, led by Nemesio Oseguera, also known as El Mencho, it\u2019s one of Mexico\u2019s newest and fastest growing cartels and it operates in Nayarit. After his arrest, Veytia appeared before a federal magistrate judge Tuesday and was being held in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in San Diego, according to custody records.\u00a0His hearing is scheduled for April 11, when it will be decided if he will face charges in New York, where El Chapo is currently being held. A lawyer for Veytia told NBC News he was just learning about the case and couldn\u2019t comment. Law enforcement sources told NBC News that Veytia was on their radar for some time and he was arrested as soon as possible. Veytia\u2019s political career began in 2008 when he was named transit director of Tepic  by then-mayor Roberto Sandoval , who is now the governor of Nayarit. Veytia was placed in charge of security in the municipality a year later and in 2011 moved to a post at the state Attorney General\u2019s office when Sandoval was elected governor. Gov.\u00a0Sandoval called the charges against his prosecutor \u201cspeculations\u201d and said his government welcomed investigations by U.S. and Mexican officials. Sandoval also issued a statement pledging to uphold public safety.\u00a0\u201cI want to make it very clear to the people of Nayarit, men and women, as your governor, I will personally take care of security,\u201d he\u00a0said. \u201cWe will not lower our guard; we will remain one of the safest states.\u201d\u00a0At a news conference, the governor also announced that he has replaced Veytia with\u00a0Carlos Alberto Rodriguez Valdez as\u00a0attorney general. If convicted, the U.S. would seek at least $250 million of\u00a0Veytia\u2019s assets linked to his drug manufacturing and distributing, according to the indictment. \u201cDiablo\u2019s\u201d arrest comes a little over a month after the Department of Treasury\u00a0said\u00a0that Venezuela\u2019s vice president is in fact a drug lord.

News of the arrest came a day after officials in Chihuahua state, which borders Texas and New Mexico, said a judge issued an arrest warrant for former governor Cesar Duarte. Chihuahua state officials have also jailed three other senior members of his administration. All are accused of embezzlement during their six-year term that ended in October. \u201cWe\u2019re going after the entire network of political corruption\u2026headed by Duarte,\u201d Chihuahua Gov. Javier Corral, who successfully campaigned on anticorruption promises for the opposition conservative National Action Party, told a press conference Tuesday. He said Mr. Duarte has taken refuge in El Paso, Texas, and that state officials would try to have him extradited. Mr. Duarte previously has denied any wrongdoing. His aides have also denied wrongdoing. Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s official photo. Both Mr. Duarte and Mr. Sandoval are members of President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. Other former PRI governors, including those of the Gulf Coast states of Veracruz and Tamaulipas, are also fugitives from justice, with several of them facing U.S. as well as Mexican criminal charges. The PRI, which ruled Mexico uninterrupted for most of the 20th century and returned to power with Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto four years ago, is struggling to reform its image in the run up to important state elections in June and a presidential vote next year. In large part due to corruption scandals, President Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s approval rating stands at about 15%. The scandals come as violence across Mexico is rising fast, particularly in states run by PRI governors accused of corruption. In Chihuahua, a battle is on among drug gangs for the state\u2019s drug trafficking routes into the U.S., said Tony Payan, a Chihuahua native who is director of the Mexico Center at the Baker Institute, a think tank at Rice University in Houston.

(Photo: Carlos Barria/Reuters) Jump to... Questions Background Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by Valerie Volcovici and Jeff Mason, Reuters) WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0President Donald Trump on Tuesday signed an executive order to undo Obama-era climate change regulations, keeping a campaign promise to support the coal industry and calling into question U.S. support for an international deal to fight global warming. Flanked by coal miners and coal company executives, President Trump proclaimed his executive order at the headquarters of the Environmental Protection Agency. \u201cEnergy Independence\u201d The move drew swift backlash from a coalition of 23 mostly Democrat-led states and local governments, as well as environmental groups, which called the decree a threat to public health and vowed to fight it in court. The order\u2019s main target is former President Barack Obama\u2019s , which required states to slash carbon emissions from power plants \u2013 a key factor in the United States\u2019 ability to meet its commitments under the 2015 Paris\u00a0climate change accord signed by President Obama. Clean Power Plan President Trump\u2019s decree also reverses a ban on coal leasing on federal lands, undoes rules to curb methane emissions from oil and gas production and reduces the weight of climate change and carbon emissions in policy and infrastructure permitting decisions. Carbon dioxide and methane are two of the main greenhouse gases blamed by scientists for heating the earth. \u201cI am taking historic steps to lift restrictions on American energy, to reverse government intrusion and to cancel job-killing regulations,\u201d President Trump said at the EPA. The room was filled with miners, coal company executives and staff from industry groups, who applauded loudly as President Trump spoke. Shares in U.S. coal companies edged higher in response. The wide-ranging order is the boldest yet in President Trump\u2019s broader push to cut environmental regulation to revive the drilling and mining industries, a promise he made repeatedly during the 2016 presidential campaign. \u2026 \u201cI cannot tell you how many jobs the executive order is going to create, but I can tell you that it provides confidence in this administration\u2019s commitment to the coal industry,\u201d Kentucky Coal Association president Tyler White told Reuters. \u2026U.S. presidents have aimed to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil since the Arab oil embargo of the 1970s, which triggered soaring prices. But the United States still imports about 7.9 million barrels of crude oil a day, almost enough to meet total oil demand in Japan and India combined. An overwhelming majority of scientists believe that human use of oil and coal for energy is a main driver of climate change, causing a damaging rise in sea levels, droughts and more frequent violent storms. But President Trump and several members of his administration have doubts about climate change, and Trump promised during his campaign to pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord , arguing it hurts U.S. business. Since being elected, President Trump has been mum on the Paris deal and the executive order does not address it. \u2026 The order directs the EPA to start a formal process to undo the Clean Power Plan, which was introduced by Obama in 2014 but was never implemented in part because of legal challenges brought by [24]\u00a0states. President Obama\u2019s\u00a0Clean Power Plan required states to collectively cut carbon emissions from power plants by 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. \u2026 (Additional reporting by Timothy Gardner; writing by Richard Valdmanis; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Cynthia Osterman) Reprinted here for educational purposes only.

Background ON GLOBAL WARMING: The theory of global warming is that the earth\u2019s temperature is rising due to man\u2019s use of fossil fuels (gas, oil, coal).\u00a0 It is believed that this\u00a0temperature change\u00a0will result in catastrophic problems in the environment.\u00a0\u00a0To prevent catastrophic\u00a0climate change, countries need to restrict energy use (reduce/eliminate use of gas, oil and coal). Global warming is a controversial issue.\u00a0 Scientists today have two opposing views on global warming: First \u2013\u00a0the planet is warming as a result of human actions;\u00a0an extreme, deadly change in the earth\u2019s climate is going to\u00a0occur, caused by greenhouse gas emitted by the world\u2019s use of fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas). Check out two\u00a0liberal organizations which defend this viewpoint: Natural Resources Defense Council \u00a0and Greenpeace . Second \u2013 fossil fuels (using gas, coal and oil for energy and electricity)\u00a0does not cause climate change;\u00a0an extreme and catastrophic change in the earth\u2019s climate won\u2019t happen. \u00a0Global warming is not a scientifically proven fact.\u00a0 Two\u00a0conservative organizations which support this view are: FriendsOfScience \u00a0and ClimateDepot . President Obama in August 2015 announced his Clean Power Plan  which requires states to reduce carbon output from hundreds of power plants across the nation \u2013 ordering a 32 percent cut in the power sector\u2019s carbon emissions by 2030, compared with 2005 levels. Responding the the Obama plan, a coalition of 24 states and a coal mining company filed lawsuits in October 2015 to challenge the regulations. They accused the EPA of going far beyond the authority Congress granted to it by ordering a significant transformation of states\u2019 electricity generation, forcing states to move away from fossil fuels like coal and toward lower-carbon emitting sources like wind and solar power. West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey listed the arguments against the rule: that it will hurt his state\u2019s coal mining industry it will raise power rates for consumers it will risk electricity reliability (from a 10/26/15 Daily News Article \u201c 24 states sue Obama over coal plant emissions rule \u201d) Why 24 states oppose President Obama\u2019s rule for power plants: The Rule forces States to develop plans to dramatically reduce carbon dioxide emissions by an average of 32 percent by 2030. EPA says this goal can be accomplished by reducing or eliminating coal-based energy generation. \u201cEPA claims to have sweeping power to enact such regulations based on a rarely-used provision of the Clean Air Act but such\u00a0legal authority simply does not exist,\u201d Attorney General Morrisey said. Forcing such drastic changes in electricity production, coal-fired plants will be subjected to costly compliance  measures or closure, leading to skyrocketing electricity rates and loss of reliable electricity for West Virginian families. \u201cAs Attorney General, I have a responsibility to protect the lives of millions of working families, the elderly and the poor, from such illegal and unconscionable Federal Government actions,\u201d Morrisey said. \u201cIt\u2019s the people who can afford it least who are going to be affected the most.\u201d The States argue the Rule is illegal and will have devastating impacts upon the States and their citizens. T he Section 111(d) rule exceeds EPA\u2019s authority by unlawfully forc ing States to fundamentally alter state resource-planning and energy policy by shifting from coal-fired generation to other sources of power generation, with a significant emphasis on renewable sources. The Rule is also illegal because it seeks to require States to regulate coal-fired power plants under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act, even though EPA already regulates those same plants under Section 112 of the Act. (from the West Virginia Attorney General\u2019s website ) The U.S., Europe and Japan may debate the merits of coal versus nuclear, natural gas, wind and other cleaner fuels, but for developing countries that have considerably less income and wealth to pay for power projects, those more-expensive sources of power are rarely realistic alternatives. For this vast swath of humanity, coal remains the main or only alternative to improve their lives with a reliable energy source. (from a commentary on coal ) View a chart: Sources of Energy in the U.S. The goal of the Paris Climate Summit in December 2015  was to \u201cto save the world from global warming.\u201d The aim was to get a treaty committing 196 nations to stop global temperatures rising more than 2 degrees C or even less above their pre-industrial level, . World leaders insisted we must all stop using those \u201cpolluting\u201d fossil fuels which still provide 86 percent of global energy. by wholesale \u201cdecarbonizing\u201d of the world\u2019s economy To this end, the world\u2019s richer \u201cdeveloped nations\u201d would also give $100 billion a year to all those countries still developing after 2020 to to enable them to rely only on \u201cclean\u201d energy \u2013 wind and solar \u2013 for their energy.

Questions Background Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (Compiled from reports at The New York Times and Reuters) UNITED NATIONS \u2014 Saying the time was not right to outlaw nuclear arms,\u00a0the United States, Britain and France \u2013 and\u00a0almost 40 other countries \u2013 did\u00a0not join talks on a treaty to ban nuclear weapons that started\u00a0at the United Nations this week. \u201cThere is nothing I want more for my family than a world with no\u00a0nuclear weapons,\u201d U.S. Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley \u00a0told reporters outside the General Assembly as the talks were getting underway. \u201cBut we have to be realistic. Is there anyone who thinks that North Korea would ban nuclear weapons?\u201d Ambassador Haley told reporters the countries skipping the negotiations are instead committed to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (see \u201cBackground\u201d below) which entered into force in 1970 and is aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology. Ms. Haley and other ambassadors standing with her, including envoys from Albania, Britain, France and South Korea, declined to take questions. The United Nations General Assembly adopted  a resolution  in December \u2013 113 in favor to 35 against, with 13 abstentions \u2013 that decided to and encouraged all member states to participate. \u201cnegotiate a legally binding instrument to prohibit nuclear weapons, leading towards their total elimination\u201d The talks, supported by more than 120 countries, were first announced in October and are led by Austria, Brazil, Ireland, Mexico, South Africa and Sweden. Disarmament  groups strongly support the effort. The United States and most other nuclear powers, including Russia, oppose the talks. \u201cYou are going to see almost 40 countries that are not in the General Assembly today,\u201d Haley said. \u201cIn this day and time we can\u2019t honestly that say we can protect our people by allowing the bad actors to have them and those of us that are good, trying to keep peace and safety, not to have them.\u201d The talks come against the backdrop of increasing worries over the intentions of a reclusive North Korea, which\u00a0has tested nuclear weapons and missiles\u00a0that could conceivably carry them. Defying international sanctions, the North Koreans have threatened to strike the United States and its allies with what North Korea\u2019s state news media has called the \u201cnuclear sword of justice.\u201d Explaining his country\u2019s\u00a0position, British Ambassador Matthew Rycroft  said: \u201cThe UK is not attending the negotiations on a treaty to prohibit nuclear weapons because we do not believe that those negotiations will lead to effective progress on global nuclear disarmament.\u201d Ambassador Haley and Ambassador\u00a0Rycroft emphasized that the U.S. and Britain\u00a0have vastly reduced the size of their nuclear arsenals since the height of the Cold War. Deputy French U.N, Ambassador Alexis Lamek  said the security conditions were not right for a nuclear weapons ban treaty. \u201cIn the current perilous context, considering in particular the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery, our countries continue to rely on nuclear deterrence for security and stability,\u201d Lamek said. Ms. Haley questioned whether countries favoring a weapons ban understood the nature of global threats. Referring to nations participating in the talks, she said, \u201cYou have to ask yourself, are they looking out for their people?\u201d Ms. Haley\u2019s counterparts from Russia and China, both veto-wielding permanent members of the Security Council, did not join her protest group. But they are not participating in the talks. Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov of Russia  said in Moscow last week that his government did not support a global nuclear weapons ban, essentially agreeing with the American position. \u201cEfforts to coerce nuclear powers to abandon nuclear weapons have intensified significantly recently,\u201d Tass \u2013 the Russian government\u2019s \u00a0news agency\u00a0quoted him as saying. \u201cIt is absolutely clear that the time has not yet come for that.\u201d Compiled from news reports at The New York Times and Reuters published on March 27.\u00a0Reprinted here for educational purposes only.

Background The UN\u2019s\u00a0Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ): Under the United Nations Non Proliferation Treaty (NPT) countries are not allowed to make nuclear weapons \u2013 except for the 5 that had nuclear weapons prior to the treaty: the U.S., Russia, China, France, the United Kingdom. The aim of the UN\u2019s Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is to limit the spread of nuclear weapons. There are currently 189 countries party to the treaty, five of which have nuclear weapons: \u2013 (the permanent members of the UN Security Council). the United States,\u00a0the United Kingdom,\u00a0France,\u00a0Russia,\u00a0China Only four recognized sovereign states are not parties to the NPT treaty: India, Pakistan and North Korea have openly tested and are presumed to possess nuclear weapons. Israel has had a policy of nontransparancy regarding its own nuclear weapons program. North Korea acceded to the treaty, violated it, and later withdrew. India, Israel, Pakistan and North Korea. Iran\u2019s 20 year secret nuclear program was discovered in 2002. Iran continues to claim that its program is for fuel purposes only, but it has been working on uranium enrichment which is used to make nuclear bombs. [NOTE ON URANIUM ENRICHMENT: Enriched uranium is a critical component for both civil nuclear power generation and military nuclear weapons. The UN\u2019s International Atomic Energy Agency attempts to monitor and control enriched uranium supplies and processes in its efforts to ensure nuclear power generation safety and curb nuclear weapons proliferation (buildup).] Numerous economic sanctions imposed on Iran were beginning to take a toll on the country\u2019s economy, but in July 2015 President Barack Obama negotiated an agreement with Iran in which Iranian leaders said they would put a 10 year hold on their nuclear program in exchange for the dropping of sanctions against them. The Iranian government has called for the destruction of Israel on numerous occasions. It is believed that once obtained,\u00a0the Iranian government\u00a0would use nuclear weapons against Israel. The following is an unofficial list of the 101 states that attended the organizational meeting on February 16, 2017 to prepare for negotiations on the treaty prohibiting nuclear weapons. There were also three observers: Holy See, Palestine and the European Union.

THE UNITED NATIONS According to WorldAtlas .com, there are 194 independent countries in the world today. 192 countries are UN members. The exceptions are Taiwan (in 1971, the UN ousted Taiwan and replaced it with the People\u2019s Republic of China) and Vatican City. Kosovo is not yet a member (it is not recognized as an independent country by all). Each country gets one vote in the UN General Assembly. The U.S. pays at least 22% of the overall yearly budget of the UN. ON THE U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL: (read more at the website un.org/Docs/sc/unsc_background.html ) The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) is\u00a0charged with the maintenance of international peace and security. Its powers, outlined in the United Nations Charter, include the establishment of peacekeeping operations, the establishment of international sanctions, and the authorization of military action. Its powers are exercised through United Nations Security Council Resolutions. There are 15 members of the Security Council, consisting of five veto-wielding permanent members (China, France, Russia, United Kingdom, United States) and ten elected members with two-year terms [these are not eligible for immediate re-election] The ten elected\u00a0members are elected by the General Assembly for two-year terms starting on January 1st, with five replaced each year. The members are chosen by regional groups and confirmed by the United Nations General Assembly. The African bloc chooses three members; the Latin America and the Caribbean, Asian, and Western European and Others blocs choose two members each; and the Eastern European bloc chooses one member. Also, one of these members is an \u201cArab country,\u201d alternately from the Asian or African bloc. Security Council members must always be present at UN headquarters in New York so that the Security Council can meet at any time. This requirement of the United Nations Charter was adopted to address a weakness of the League of Nations since that organization was often unable to respond quickly to a crisis. Each Council member has one vote. Decisions on procedural matters are made by an affirmative vote of at least nine of the 15 members. Decisions on substantive matters (including imposing sanctions on a country) require nine votes, including the concurring votes of all five permanent members. Under the UN Charter, all 191 Member States (countries) of the United Nations agree to accept and carry out the decisions of the Security Council.\u00a0 While other organs of the United Nations make recommendations to Governments, the Council alone has the power to make decisions which Member States are obligated under the Charter to carry out.

Questions Background Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by James MacPherson for the Associated Press at BismarkTribune) BISMARCK, N.D. \u2014 Republican Gov. Doug Burgum  has signed legislation that will allow most adults to carry a hidden firearm without a permit, making North Dakota one of about a dozen \u201cconstitutional carry\u201d  states. The bill ( ND House Bill 1169 ) signed into law late Thursday will allow law-abiding people 18 and older to forgo background checks and classes that are now required. The legislation only requires someone carrying a concealed weapon to have a valid ID and notify law enforcement of the weapon during instances such as a traffic stop. The legislation comes into force Aug. 1. Burgum, who is an avid hunter, urged anyone pondering carrying a concealed firearm to enroll in gun safety classes. \u201cGun ownership is both a right and a responsibility,\u201d the governor said in a statement. \u201cThat responsibility begins with individuals and families.\u201d The law sailed through both houses of the GOP-led Legislature, with dissention largely among Democrats. Supporters said the bill promotes the constitutional right to bear arms and allows protection from criminals. Critics [claim]\u00a0it could lead to more shootings as people with less training would be carrying weapons. Carrying a hidden firearm without a permit is currently a misdemeanor, punishable by up to 30 days in jail and a fine of up to $1,500. The bill was among a package of gun-rights measures being considered this session, including allowing people with concealed carry permits to have guns in churches, schools and other public places. It\u2019s unclear if Burgum will also sign those into law. The number of concealed carry permits in North Dakota has more than doubled in the past five years to 48,700. North Dakota residents already can get a concealed carry permit by completing an hour-long class and passing an open-book test. The classes cost about $50. An enhanced license, that allows reciprocity with other states, requires firearms training and the open-book test. The South Dakota Legislature this month approved a similar measure but GOP Gov. Dennis Daugaard vetoed it, saying his state\u2019s gun laws are already reasonable. Questions 1. The first paragraph of a news article should answer the questions who, what, where and when.

Background Constitutional carry: The term constitutional carry \u00a0is a newer term for the legal carrying of a handgun, both openly and concealed, without the requirement of a government permit. The phrase does not typically refer to the unrestricted carrying of a long gun, a knife, or other weapons. The scope and applicability of such laws or proposed legislation can vary from state to state. The phrase \u201cconstitutional carry\u201d reflects the view that the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution permits no restrictions or other regulations on gun ownership, although District of Columbia v. Heller, decided by the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) in 2008, suggests that some state or local controls may be allowed, at least as to certain types of weapons.\u00a0(from wikipedia ) Recent Daily News Articles Veterans Day 2017: Vets Plan To Boycott NFL Games On Sunday November 10, 2017 EPA approves bacteria-infected insects to kill mosquitoes November 9, 2017 Pa. officials still mostly mum on noncitizens registered to vote November 8, 2017 Tuesday\u2019s World News #1 \u2013 Lebanon November 7, 2017 US deserter Bowe Bergdahl spared prison time November 6, 2017 Get the App Follow Us Elsewhere About  \u00a0\u2014 Site Overview  \u00a0\u2014 Contact Us  \u00a0\u2014 Donate Launched in 2005, StudentNewsDaily.com is a 501(c)3 non-profit educational website.

Questions Background Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by Ariel Zilber, UK Daily Mail) \u2013 Retired football stars are suing the\u00a0National Football League\u00a0in federal court over claims that all 32 teams and their medical staffs administered powerful prescription drugs each season in a desperate bid to keep them on the field. The lawsuit was filed in US District Court in northern\u00a0California \u00a0by a group representing over 1,800 former professional NFL players, according to\u00a0The Washington Post. The players claim  that they are suffering from long-term organ damage as well as other health maladies  that they believe stem from the haphazard  manner in which team physicians plied them with painkillers and anti-inflammatory medication. They allege  that the NFL failed to comply  with federal laws that regulate the administration of the drugs by team medics. The Post report, which was based on unsealed documents from the lawsuit, claims that team doctors \u201ctestified that they violated one or more\u201d federal laws \u201cwhile serving in their capacity as team doctor.\u201d One prominent team doctor, Anthony Yates  of the Pittsburgh Steelers\u2019 medical staff, is a former president of the NFL Physicians Society . Yates testified in a deposition  that \u201ca majority of clubs as of 2010 had trainers controlling and handling prescription medications and controlled substances when they should not have.\u201d The players allege  that the NFL teams and the league itself were made aware of violations of the law, but either were slow to respond or turned a blind eye, according to the Post. The lawsuit cites an email written by the head trainer of the Cincinnati Bengals, Paul Sparling , in August 2009. \u201cCan you have your office fax a copy of your DEA certificate to me? I need it for my records when the NFL \u2018pill counters\u2019 come to see if we are doing things right. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m pretty good at keeping them off the trail!\u201d he wrote. The players claim that the teams\u2019 medical staffs displayed a cavalier  attitude in prescribing the drugs. According to court filings, NFL team doctors prescribed at least 5,777 doses of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory [NSAID] drugs  as well as 2,213 doses of controlled medications in 2012 alone. That averages out to approximately six or seven pain pills or injections per player per week over the course of a typical NFL season \u2013 an astounding number, according to sports medicine experts. While it is difficult to gauge the extent of alleged abuses given that it is hard to know the exact dosage given to players, the potency of the painkillers and their vulnerability to addiction, like Vicodin, is cause for alarm. The lawsuit alleges  that NFL teams pressured their medical staffs to inject their players with painkillers for competitive reasons. The NFL has denied the allegations  contained in the lawsuit. A spokesperson says that the league will fight the claims in court. \u201cThe NFL clubs and their medical staffs are all in compliance  with the Controlled Substances Act ,\u201d NFL spokesperson Brian McCarthy  told the Post. \u201cThe NFL clubs and their medical staffs continue to put the health and safety of our players first, providing all NFL players with the highest quality medical care.

It makes you think, are the physicians looking out for the health of the players, or are they just trying to keep them on the field?\u201d Drug experts who reviewed the data for The Post cautioned that a thorough understanding of the league\u2019s use of pain medication is limited without knowing the exact dosages, types of controlled substances administered and whether all the players on a team were consuming the medications or whether a smaller number accounted for a larger percentage of the drug use.

This meeting took place at the Department of State in Washington D.C.  It was the first meeting of the full Coalition since December 2014. Jump to... Questions Background Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (compiled from reports at Los Angeles Times, CNN, RT, VOA News and Reuters) \u2013 U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson  is hosting a meeting of the 68-member US-led coalition against Islamic State (IS, also known as\u00a0ISIS/ISIL). The Washington, DC summit is the first meeting of the full coalition since December 2014. The Obama administration did not meet with the full coalition during the last two years of his presidency. President\u00a0Trump signed an executive order on January 28  directing his national security team to come up with a strategy to defeat the group. The president\u00a0promised to\u00a0\u201cdemolish and destroy\u201d\u00a0ISIS, Tillerson told the coalition envoys in his opening remarks. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do,\u201d he said, adding,\u00a0\u201cI recognize there are many pressing challenges in the Middle East, but defeating ISIS is the United States\u2019 No. 1 goal in the region.\u00a0When everything is a priority, nothing is a priority. We must continue to keep our focus on the most urgent matter at hand.\u201d Secretary Tillerson\u00a0said the coalition had made significant progress against the terrorist group, with the flow of foreign fighters into the region down by 90 percent and Islamic State online content down by 75 percent. Turkey has pushed ISIS back from the border, while in Iraq, government forces and Kurdish Peshmerga are working together to liberate Mosul. \u201cAll of [ISIS leader Abu Bakr] al-Baghdadi\u2019s deputies are now dead,\u201d\u00a0Tillerson said, referring to the leader of the self-proclaimed caliphate.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time before Baghdadi himself meets the same fate.\u201d Defeating the terrorist group is the\u00a0\u201cnumber one US goal in the region,\u201d\u00a0Tillerson said, adding that the coalition will focus on\u00a0\u201cregional elimination of ISIS through military force.\u00a0As a coalition, we\u2019re not in the business of nation-building or reconstruction,\u201d\u00a0Tillerson said, adding that resources should be focused on preventing the resurgence of ISIS and equipping war-torn communities to rebuild. The US is currently providing 75 percent of coalition military resources in support of local forces in Iraq and Syria, the secretary of state said, adding that for humanitarian efforts, the proportion is reversed. \u00a0\u201cThe US will do its part, but the\u00a0circumstances on the ground require more from all of you,\u201d\u00a0Tillerson said. Coalition forces will remain in territories claimed by\u00a0\u201cthe fraudulent caliphate\u201d\u00a0to ensure stability, Tillerson said. While he gave no further details, any coalition military presence inside Syria is seen as unacceptable by the government in Damascus, which \u2013 unlike Baghdad \u2013 did not invite the US-led forces into the country. Syria\u2019s President Bashar Assad instead works with Russia to fight moderate rebels instead of waging war against Islamic State fighters. Tillerson also touched on the proposal to create\u00a0\u201csafe areas\u201d\u00a0in Syria, describing them as\u00a0\u201cinterim zones of stability\u201d\u00a0that would be created through ceasefires to improve the safety of resident and displaced civilians. Beyond the battlefield, the coalition needs to focus on stamping out IS cells and online presence and denying the group the legitimacy it seeks, Tillerson said. \u201cWe must prevent their seeds of hatred from taking root elsewhere,\u201d\u00a0he said, including both cells around the world and online presence.\u00a0\u201cA digital caliphate must not flourish in the place of the physical one.\u201d Tillerson urged the coalition members to overcome agency and national rivalries in order to share intelligence and cooperate with law enforcement\u2019s counter-terrorism efforts. While the coalition\u2019s\u00a0\u201ccounter-messaging hubs\u201d\u00a0in the UK, the United Arab Emirates and Malaysia are making progress, Saudi Arabia and Egypt have an important role to play in hammering the\u00a0\u201cwarped interpretation of Islam\u201d\u00a0championed by the group, said the US secretary of state. The Coalition\u2019s foreign ministers were scheduled to discuss the priorities in the struggle against the terrorist group, from military efforts and the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Iraq and Syria to\u00a0\u201ccounter-messaging and stabilization of liberated areas,\u201d\u00a0the State Department said in a\u00a0statement. Questions 1. The first paragraph of a news article should answer the questions who, what, where and when. List the who, what, where and when of this news item. (NOTE: The remainder of a news article provides details on the why and/or how.) 2. What did President Trump\u2019s January 28 executive order direct his national security team to do? (Note: Rex Tillerson was not confirmed by the Senate until February 1.) 3. What progress has been made so far in the fight against the Islamic State? 4. What is the Trump administration\u2019s main goal in the fight against ISIS? 5. For what reason is Secretary Tillerson asking the more than 60 coalition partners to contribute more financially? 6. a) What does the coalition need to do beyond the battlefield, according to Secretary Tillerson? b) What did the Secretary urge coalition members to do going forward? 7. The media outlets that reported on this meeting noted that Tillerson did not give details on specifics in the effort to destroy the Islamic State. a) What reason could there be for the U.S. to refrain from giving specific details of the plan? b) Ask a parent: Trump and Obama have very different leadership styles. Obama famously \u201cled from behind\u201d and referred to ISIS as \u201cthe JV team.\u201d Trump has set out to fulfill all of the promises he made during his campaign. He appoints the people he thinks will best carry out the jobs. Do you think the U.S. and our coalition partners will be able to successfully destroy the Islamic State organization with Donald Trump as the president or did President Obama have a better strategy for dealing with ISIS?

They rely on Iraqi security forces and Kurdish guerrillas in Iraq, and U.S.-backed rebel militias in Syria, to carry out combat operations, while the U.S. and its allies provide intelligence, launch airstrikes and fire artillery to support the ground attacks. Over the last year, the combined attacks have pushed out the Sunni militants from most major cities in Iraq. Despite a five-month U.S.-backed assault, heavy fighting is still underway to retake the group\u2019s remaining stronghold in Mosul, Iraq\u2019s second largest city. The challenge is tougher in Syria, where the Pentagon has backed the Syrian Democratic Forces, a coalition of mostly Kurdish rebel groups that operates chiefly in northern Syria. Preparations are underway for an assault on the Islamic States\u2019\u00a0self-declared capital of Raqqah. Long-term challenges will be to rebuild the cities and towns destroyed by Islamic State during their occupation, or by coalition bombardments that sought to dislodge them. Tillerson will ask other coalition nations to invest in the recaptured areas and to help provide humanitarian aid and other resources for the millions of people displaced in the fighting. \u201cWe will continue to facilitate the return of people to their homes and work with local political leadership,\u201d he said Wednesday. \u201cThey will provide stable and fair governance, rebuild infrastructure\u00a0and provide essential services,\u201d\u00a0he added. \u201cWe will use our diplomatic presence on the ground to facilitate channels of dialogue between local leadership and coalition partners.\u201d (from a March 22 report at the Los Angeles Times by W.J.

Questions Background Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by David Shepardson, Reuters) WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0The Trump administration on Tuesday imposed restrictions on carry-on electronic devices on non-stop flights\u00a0coming to the United States from 10 airports\u2026in the Middle East and North Africa in response to unspecified terrorism threats. The Department of Homeland Security [DHS]  said passengers traveling from those airports could not bring devices larger than a cellphone, such as tablets, portable DVD players, laptops and cameras, into the main cabin. Instead, they must be in checked baggage. (read the Fact Sheet at DHS.gov ) The new restrictions were prompted by reports that [Islamic terrorist]\u00a0groups [including ISIS and Al Qaeda] want to smuggle explosive devices in electronic gadgets, officials told reporters on a conference call on Monday. They did not provide further details on the threat. [See BBC video under \u201cResouces\u201d below for an explanation Reuters and other media don\u2019t appear to be aware of.] The airports are in Cairo, Egypt; Istanbul, Turkey; Kuwait City, Kuwait; Doha, Qatar; Casablanca, Morocco; Amman, Jordan; Riyadh and Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; and Dubai and Abu Dhabi in United Arab Emirates. \u2026 DHS spokeswoman Gillian Christensen  said the government \u201cdid not target specific nations. We relied upon evaluated intelligence to determine which airports were affected.\u201d \u2026The airports affected by the electronics rules are served by nine airlines that fly directly from those cities to the United States about 50 flights a day, senior government officials said.\u00a0The policy does not affect any American carriers because none fly directly to the United States from the airports, officials said. The carriers with non-stop flights \u2013 Royal Jordanian Airlines, Egypt Air, Turkish Airlines, Saudi Arabian Airlines, Kuwait Airways [KA.UL], Royal Air Maroc, Qatar Airways, Emirates and Etihad Airways \u2013 have until Friday to comply with the new policy, which took effect early on Tuesday and will be in place indefinitely. Several of the carriers, including Turkish Airlines, Etihad and Qatar, said early on Tuesday that they were quickly moving to comply. Royal Jordanian and Saudi Airlines said on Monday that they were immediately putting the directive into place. \u2026 DHS officials did not explain why the restrictions only apply to travelers arriving in the United States and not for those same flights when they leave from there. The rules apply to U.S. citizens traveling on those flights, but not to crew members on those foreign carriers. Homeland Security will allow passengers to use larger approved medical devices. Angela Gittens , director general of airport association ACI World, likened the move to years-long restrictions of liquids on planes, which she said also came suddenly, in response to a perceived threat, and caused some disruption. Airlines will adjust to the electronics policy, she said. \u201cThe first few days of something like this are quite problematic, but just as with the liquids ban, it will start to sort itself out.\u201d DHS said the procedures would \u201cremain in place until the threat changes\u201d and did not rule out expanding them to other airports.\u00a0The agency said in a statement it \u201cseeks to balance risk with impacts to the traveling public and has determined that cellphones and smartphones will be allowed in accessible property at this time.\u201d The government said it was \u201cconcerned about terrorists\u2019 ongoing interest in targeting commercial aviation, including transportation hubs over the past two years.\u201d Reuters reported Monday that the move had been under consideration since the U.S. government learned of a threat several weeks ago. U.S. officials have told Reuters the information gleaned from a U.S. commando raid in January in Yemen that targeted al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula included bombmaking techniques. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), based in Yemen, has plotted to down U.S. airliners\u2026.\u00a0The group claimed responsibility for a Dec. 25, 2009, failed attempt by a Nigerian Islamist to down an airliner over Detroit. The device, hidden in the underwear of the man, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, failed to detonate. In 2010, security officials in Britain and Dubai intercepted parcel bombs sent from Yemen to the United States. The Homeland Security Department under President Obama stepped up security of U.S.-bound flights in July 2014, requiring tougher screening of mobile phones and other electronic devices and requiring them to be powered up before passengers could board flights to the United States.

Last year, 42.4 million Americans owed $1.3 trillion in federal student loans. More than 4.2 million borrowers were in default as of the end of 2016, up from 3.6 million in 2015. In all, 1.1 million more borrowers went into or re-entered default last year. People who have defaulted on their student loans \u201care going to have a tougher time passing an employment verification check, saving for retirement or ever buying a home,\u201d Chopra said. Borrowers in default can also have their wages garnished and their tax refunds seized. \u2026 You can avoid defaulting by borrowing an appropriate  amount for you or your children\u2019s college education. Mark Kantrowitz, vice president of strategy for college and scholarship search site Cappex .com recommends that students generally take out no more debt than their expected first year\u2019s salary out of college. People with unmanageable student debt have several options: If you have federal student loans, you can qualify for income-based repayment  plans. The percentage of federal student loan borrowers enrolled in repayment plans has quadrupled over the past four years from 5 percent in 2012 to nearly 20 percent in 2016. One drawback  to income-based repayment plans is that you have to re-apply every year to qualify for lower payments. To make matters worse, the IRS data retrieval tool that helps borrowers apply for these repayment plans will be down for several weeks, the agency said. Lawmakers from both parties have supported a bill that would require federal student loan borrowers in distress to be automatically enrolled in income-based repayment plans and to make it easier for people to stay enrolled in those plans, said Pauline Abernathy, executive vice president of the Institute for College Access & Success. People with private student loans face limited options. Some private lenders offer forbearance if borrowers can\u2019t make their payments. Those benefits aren\u2019t as robust as those with federal loans and typically last no more than 12 months. And unlike most other debt, you usually can\u2019t get rid of student loans through bankruptcy. First published at CNBC on March 8, 2017. Reprinted here for educational purposes only.

Questions Background Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by Julian E. Barnes, The Wall Street Journal) VILSECK, Germany \u2014 \u2026When the Army rolls into Poland next month to take\u00a0positions near the Russian border\u2026the creature comforts will stay behind. No Whoppers. No foot-long Subway sandwiches. No Pizza Hut pies or caramel lattes at the Army\u2019s version of\u00a0Starbucks,\u00a0Green Beans. \u201cYou are never going to see Burger King,\u201d Lt. Gen.\u00a0Ben Hodges,\u00a0the top Army commander in Europe , warned soldiers of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment  at a recent rehearsal drill. \u201cBe ready for potatoes three meals a day for six months. The Irish have figured out how to make it interesting. I am sure you can, too.\u201d Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, the top U.S. Army commander in Europe. In Iraq and Afghanistan, soldiers stationed at big U.S. bases got used to [having access to]\u00a0American fast food and shopping at military strip malls. \u201cWe went a little too far on some of the luxuries,\u201d says the regiment\u2019s Command Sgt. Maj.\u00a0Kevin Muhlenbeck ,\u00a0a veteran of both conflicts. \u201cWe set a climate that soldiers weren\u2019t in a combat zone anymore. They weren\u2019t in the right mind-set to fight tonight.\u201d On the menu for Poland: austerity . \u201cThe standard of living is Spartan \u2014Spartan, plus Wi-Fi,\u201d Gen. Hodges told the soldiers, to some chuckling. The Army says the internet is necessary for soldiers to keep up with paperwork, to Skype family members and to watch\u00a0Netflix. Some soldiers plan to get their fill before they leave their German base for Poland. \u201cI am probably going to hit the American Burger King on post at least twice this week,\u201d says Sgt. Zackary Cowher, 27 years old. \u201cAnd then I am going to get out to one of the German Pizza Huts.\u201d Last year, NATO approved a deterrent  force\u00a0in Poland and the Baltic States to counter Russia\u2019s military buildup. After a road march through the Czech Republic and Western Poland, the U.S. Army\u2019s contribution to the NATO  force will arrive at its new position early next month. For much of the long wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the Army fought out of forward operating bases. The military called them FOBs, and soldiers who rarely left those bases were called Fobbits, especially by Marines who often lived in more rugged conditions. In 2010, when Gen.\u00a0Stanley McChrystal \u00a0was the top commander in Afghanistan, he ordered the closing of\u00a0Burger\u00a0King\u00a0at bases in that country to put the military more on a war footing. The ban lasted about a year. After Gen. McChrystal was forced to resign after his staff was quoted anonymously speaking derisively about the Obama administration, his replacement, Gen.\u00a0David Petraeus ,\u00a0decided an Army moves on its stomach. He\u00a0brought back Burger\u00a0King. \u2026In Poland, the military will send toiletries and snacks, but no Whoppers, says Command Sgt. Maj. Muhlenbeck . Meals will be taken at a Polish mess hall. Too many amenities , he says, risk creating divisions between those on the front lines and those in bigger bases. \u201cYou see how it starts eroding the fiber of teamwork,\u201d he says. \u201cSoldiers at outposts start thinking those guys have all that stuff and we don\u2019t. You actually start seeing a level of animosity between traditional combat arms soldiers and soldiers who have more of the sustainment duty.\u201d Further complicating the culinary dynamic, U.S. troops will be working alongside British, Croatian and Romanian forces and under the supervision of a Polish brigade . Gen. Hodges wants to integrate the Americans with their allies to create a seamless fighting force\u2014the most important reason, he thinks, to keep\u00a0Burger\u00a0King\u00a0out. \u201cWe are not going to have an American [separate area]\u00a0inside a Polish garrison,\u201d he says. \u201cThat defeats the whole purpose of being with our allies.\u201d The Wi-Fi exception to the Spartan ethic, he says, is a bow to the modern world. Soldiers need access to the internet to complete training, check their pay, complete various Army requirements\u2014and to play games on their laptops. \u2026 Reprinted here for educational purposes only.

Military officials say they expect Moscow to try to break into any vaguely military network, even if it is used just for streaming movies. They are warning troops to be very careful how they use Wi-Fi. \u201cIt gets back to vigilance,\u201d says Col.\u00a0William Holt,\u00a0who helps oversee cybersecurity for the U.S. Army Europe . \u201cThis is not just about the military networks, but the Wi-Fi sites as well. There are risks. We are in a contested environment, so we have to make sure we act properly and protect ourselves. \u201c Soldiers can look forward to one other exception to the Spartan barracks conditions in Poland. In Iraq and Afghanistan, the military\u2019s \u201cGeneral Order Number 1\u201d  has banned alcohol at U.S. military bases there.\u00a0European forces generally don\u2019t follow that rule. The French army in Afghanistan had wine in their field rations. The Polish army in Iraq would put on feasts with alcoholic beverages available for visiting general officers. Given the mix of soldiers in the NATO deployment, enforcing an alcohol ban would be a failing enterprise, American officers say. \u201cIt will be impossible in this environment, and I believe not necessary, to have a general order number one banning alcohol,\u201d Gen. Hodges told the 2nd Cavalry Regiment. \u201cI am sure we will have one or two knuckleheads that will do something stupid, but first sergeants know how to deal with this.\u201d Recent Daily News Articles Veterans Day 2017: Vets Plan To Boycott NFL Games On Sunday November 10, 2017 EPA approves bacteria-infected insects to kill mosquitoes November 9, 2017 Pa. officials still mostly mum on noncitizens registered to vote November 8, 2017 Tuesday\u2019s World News #1 \u2013 Lebanon November 7, 2017 US deserter Bowe Bergdahl spared prison time November 6, 2017 Get the App Follow Us Elsewhere About  \u00a0\u2014 Site Overview  \u00a0\u2014 Contact Us  \u00a0\u2014 Donate Launched in 2005, StudentNewsDaily.com is a 501(c)3 non-profit educational website.

Migrants attempting to cross the U.S.-Mexico border are at risk of being kidnapped, extorted or even killed by drug gangs. (NPR, John Moore/Getty Images) Jump to... Questions Background Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by Andrew V. Pestano, UPI) \u2014 U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security\u00a0John Kelly \u00a0said there was a 40 percent decrease in illegal crossings from Mexico into the United States from January to February. Citing data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) , Kelly said the \u201cunprecedented decline in traffic\u201d \u2014 which is measured by the apprehension and the prevention of entry of people illegally entering the United States \u2014 \u201cshows a marked change in trends\u201d since President\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0won the U.S. presidential election, particularly since he took office. \u201cSince the administration\u2019s implementation of executive orders  to enforce immigration laws, apprehensions and inadmissible activity is trending toward the lowest monthly total in at least the last five years,\u201d Kelly\u00a0wrote in a statement\u00a0on Wednesday. \u201cThis change in the trend line is especially significant because CBP  historically sees a 10-20 percent increase in apprehensions of illegal immigrants from January to February. Instead, this year we saw a drop from 31,578 to 18,762 persons \u2014 a 40 percent decline.\u201d On Jan. 25, Trump signed an executive order to strip federal grant money from so-called \u201csanctuary cities\u201d \u2014 U.S. municipalities that protect undocumented immigrants from federal prosecution. Trump\u2019s order also seeks to hire 10,000 additional immigration officers, to build more detention centers and to prioritize undocumented immigrants for deportation. Kelly also said that due to changes in U.S. policy, \u201ccoyotes\u201d  \u2014 human smugglers hired to traffic people into the United States  \u2014 have also increased their fees by about 130 percent, from $3,500 to $8,000. The higher price means fewer immigrants will likely pay to cross illegally, Kelly suggested. \u201cThe decrease is also encouraging news because it means many fewer people are putting themselves and their families at risk of exploitation, assault and injury by human traffickers and the physical dangers of the treacherous journey north,\u201d Kelly wrote. The number of unaccompanied children caught crossing the border was about 52,000 between October 2013 and June 2014. Kelly this week said his agency is considering\u00a0separating undocumented children from their parents\u00a0if caught illegally crossing the border. [He explained that\u00a0the primary objective of separating children from adults is to discourage further illegal entry via dangerous smuggling networks. \u201cYes I\u2019m considering [that] in order to deter more movement along this terribly dangerous network,\u201d Kelly told CNN. \u201cI am considering exactly that. They will be well cared for as we deal with their parents. \u00a0It is more important to me \u2026 to try to keep people off of this awful network.\u201d (see video clip under \u201cResources\u201d below) Secretary Kelly began implementing the immigration enforcement changes ordered by President Trump on Tuesday, February 21. Of note: the changes exclude \u201cdreamers\u201d \u2013 illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as children and others who had been given a reprieve in 2014.] Reprinted here for educational purposes only.

Questions BEFORE answering the questions, read the \u201cBackground\u201d and watch the videos under \u201cResources\u201d below. 1. The first paragraph of a news article should answer the questions who, what, where and when. List the who, what, where and when of this news item. (NOTE: The remainder of a news article provides details on the why and/or how.) 2. How is the number of illegal border crossings from Mexico measured? 3. To what does Secretary Kelly attribute the decrease in illegal border crossings? 4. Why is the marked decrease in illegal border crossings significant? 5. a) What are coyotes? b) Why does Secretary Kelly say the decrease in the number of people crossing the border is encouraging news? (What dangers do people face in paying a coyote to smuggle them into the U.S.?) 6. a) For what reason did Secretary Kelly say he would consider separating undocumented children from their parents if caught illegally crossing the border into the U.S.? b) Watch the videos under \u201cResources\u201d below. The media unsurprisingly portrays the consideration of this policy as inhumane. After hearing Secretary Kelly\u2019s explanation, do you think it could be actually a compassionate policy?

Background On President Trump\u2019s order to enforce federal immigration law: (from a Feb. 27 \u201c Daily News Article \u201c) On Feb. 21, U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly \u00a0began\u00a0implementation a host of immigration enforcement changes ordered by President Trump, directing agency heads [including Border Patrol and ICE] to hire thousands more officers, end so-called policies \u201ccatch-and-release\u201d and begin work on the president\u2019s promised U.S.-Mexico border wall. \u201cIt is in the national interest of the United States to prevent criminals and criminal organizations from destabilizing border security,\u201d Kelly wrote in one of two memos released Tuesday by the department. The changes exclude \u201cdreamers\u201d \u00a0(illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as children) and others given a reprieve in 2014. But outside those exemptions, Kelly wrote that DHS \u201cno longer will exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement.\u201d A DHS official said the agencies are \u201cgoing back to our traditional roots\u201d on enforcement. The memos cover a set of initiatives including: Prioritizing criminal illegal immigrants and others for deportation,\u00a0including those convicted or charged with \u201cany criminal offense,\u201d or who have \u201cabused\u201d any public welfare program Expanding the 287(g) program, which allows participating local officers to act as immigration agents \u2013 and had been rolled back under the Obama administration Starting the planning, design and construction of a U.S.-Mexico border wall Hiring 10,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and officers Hiring 5,000 Border Patrol agents Ending \u201ccatch-and-release\u201d policies under which illegal immigrants subject to deportation potentially are allowed to \u201cabscond\u201d and fail to appear at removal hearings Visit the U.S. Customs and Border Protection website \u00a0for more information.

Questions Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (Compiled from reports by David Martosko, UK Daily Mail and Chuck Ross, The Daily Caller) \u2013 U.S. companies added a whopping 298,000 new jobs in February, beating economists\u2019 expectations by more than 100,000. Economists expected 190,000 new jobs in February. The report from ADP , a global human resources and payroll firm\u00a0[that surveys the U.S. job market], provides the first hard economic numbers from\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s first full month as president. According to MarketWatch , the 298,000 figure is the highest in nearly three years, since April 2014. It is also the third-highest jobs growth number recorded since the beginning of the economic recovery. President Trump tweeted a self-congratulatory note, calling the number \u201cmuch more than expected!\u201d He also wrote Wednesday on Twitter about another similar measure, citing numbers from a new LinkedIn \u00a0workforce report  that showed strong job-adding numbers from January and February. Those months \u201cwere the strongest consecutive months for hiring since August and September 2015,\u201d the president tweeted, repeating\u00a0the report\u2019s language. Steve Liesman , an economics reporter on CNBC, called the ADP figure \u201ca big number.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a little breathless on this,\u201d he added. Liesman also said that the ADP report showed an \u201camazing balance\u201d of job creation across the economy. Construction jobs increased by 66,000 in February, and the manufacturing sector added 32,000. Another 66,000 were added in the professional and business industries, and 40,000 in education and health sectors. President Trump has pledged to dramatically improve the U.S. employment market in those sectors as he tries to lure businesses from overseas and stop jobs from fleeing across the border. He has also promised $1 trillion in new infrastructure  spending, another measure calculated to add jobs. \u201cFebruary proved to be an incredibly strong month for employment with increases we have not seen in years,\u201d Ahu Yildirmaz , vice president of the ADP Research Institute , said in a statement. January\u2019s new-jobs numbers were also revised upward on Wednesday from 246,000 to 261,000. \u201cConfidence is playing a large role,\u201d Mark Zandi , chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics , told\u00a0CNBC. \u201cBusinesses are anticipating a lot of good stuff \u2013 tax cuts, less regulation. They are hiring more aggressively.\u201d The official U.S. unemployment rate is expected to shift downward from 4.8 per cent to 4.7 per cent, in response to the official jobs numbers report, due Friday. The Labor Department will release its nonfarm payrolls number on Friday. The strong ADP number will likely raise forecasts for the Labor Department figure, which is currently expected to come in a 185,000 additional jobs. The president said Tuesday that he\u2019s preparing \u201cmassive\u201d tax cuts for businesses and individuals. Employers also are expressing encouragement about the president\u2019s efforts to cut red tape. Compiled from news reports on March 8 by London\u2019s Daily Mail and The Daily Caller.

Questions Background Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by Justin McCurry in Tokyo and news agencies, UK Guardian) \u2014\u00a0The threat posed by North Korea to the US and its allies has entered a \u201cnew phase,\u201d President\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0said on Tuesday, a day after the regime\u00a0test-launched four ballistic missiles\u00a0towards Japan. In a phone conversation on Tuesday, Mr. Trump told Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe , that the US stood \u201c100%\u201d with Tokyo after three of the intermediate-range missiles landed in the sea off\u00a0Japan\u2019s north-west coast. \u201cPresident Trump told me that the United States was with\u00a0Japan\u00a0100%, and that he wanted his comments to be communicated to the Japanese people,\u201d Abe told reporters at his residence. \u201cHe said he wanted us to trust him as well as the United States 100%.  [\u201cJapan and the United States confirmed\u201d the launches violated UN Security Council resolutions and presented a \u201cclear challenge to the region and international community, and that its threat has entered a new phase,\u201d Abe told reporters in Tokyo.] The comments came as the US said the \u201cfirst elements\u201d of its missile defense system had arrived in South Korea on Tuesday. The anti-missile system is meant to intercept and destroy short- and medium-range ballistic missiles during the last part of their flights, the US Pacific Command said in a\u00a0statement. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) \u201cContinued provocative actions by North Korea, to include yesterday\u2019s launch of multiple missiles, only confirm the prudence of our alliance decision last year to deploy THAAD to\u00a0South Korea,\u201d US Pacific Commander Admiral Harry Harris  said. China\u00a0has\u00a0denounced THAAD\u2019s deployment, [claiming]\u00a0it would compromise its security. South Korea\u2019s Yonhap news agency, citing military sources, said the system could be operational as early as April, well ahead of schedule. Mr. Trump and Mr. Abe spoke as the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, declared the launches a success and warned that they were part of a training exercise for an attack on US military bases in Japan, home to almost 50,000 American troops. \u201cThe four ballistic rockets launched simultaneously are so accurate that they look like acrobatic flying corps in formation,\u201d the state-run Korean Central News Agency quoted Kim as saying. The regime also released\u00a0images\u00a0of the missile launches, with a smiling Kim in attendance. The launches were seen as a protest against the start of the annual joint military exercises the U.S. conducts with\u00a0South Korea that Pyongyang claims are\u00a0a rehearsal for an invasion of\u00a0North Korea. A day after operation Foal Eagle began last Wednesday, North Korea\u2019s army, deploying the same vitriolic  language it reserves for the annual drills, warned that it was ready to \u201cimmediately launch its merciless military counteractions\u201d if South Korean or US forces fired \u201ceven a single shell\u201d into waters near the divided Korean peninsula. North Korea\u2019s ambassador to the UN, Ja Song-nam , said the joint exercises were driving the region towards nuclear disaster. \u201cIt may go over to an actual war,\u201d Ja said, adding: \u201cConsequently, the situation on the Korean Peninsula is again inching to the brink of a nuclear war.\u201d Prime Minister Abe said that President Trump, who was\u00a0diplomatically wrong-footed\u00a0by a\u00a0North Korean missile launch last month, had reaffirmed Washington\u2019s \u201cunwavering\u201d commitment to Japan\u2019s security. The leaders agreed that Monday\u2019s launches were in violation of UN resolutions banning Pyongyang from developing ballistic missile technology. Washington and Tokyo have requested a meeting of the UN security council on Wednesday. Prime Minister Abe said he had told President Trump that Japan was willing to take on a \u201clarge role and responsibility to enhance the deterrence provided by the Japan-US alliance.\u201d \u2026 The UN has imposed six rounds of sanctions  since the North conducted its first nuclear test in 2006, but they have failed to dent the regime\u2019s quest to build what it claims is a \u201cdefensive\u201d nuclear arsenal. President Trump has not publicly commented on Monday\u2019s missile launch, but his ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley,\u00a0said on Twitter\u00a0that the world \u201cwon\u2019t allow\u201d North Korea to continue on its \u201cdestructive path.\u201d Choi Kang, an analyst at the Seoul-based Asan Institute for Policy Studies, said the launch was a warning to Tokyo. \u201cNorth Korea is demonstrating that its target is not just limited to the Korean peninsula any more but can extend to Japan at any time and even the US,\u201d he said.

(see \u201cBackground\u201d below for the answer.) 7. Read the \u201cBackground\u201d below on North Korea. The Council on Foreign Relations reports: China is North Korea\u2019s most important ally, biggest trading partner, and main source of food, arms, and energy. It has helped sustain Kim Jong-un\u2019s regime, and has historically opposed harsh international sanctions on North Korea in the hope of avoiding regime collapse and a refugee influx across their 870-mile border. China regards stability on the Korean peninsula as its primary interest. Its support for North Korea ensures a friendly nation on its northeastern border and provides a buffer between China and the democratic South, which is home to around 29,000 U.S. troops and marines. \u201cFor the Chinese, stability and the avoidance of war are the top priorities,\u201d says Daniel Sneider of Stanford\u2019s Asia-Pacific Research Center. President Trump has said that China should be able to persuade North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons program. Do you agree with this assertion? Explain your answer.

Simply put, it\u2019s one of the most advanced missile-defense systems on Earth. Its possible future deployment to South Korea is already cause for concern in Beijing. (from an Oct. 2015 Business Insider article ) Read about THAAD\u00a0at the defense contractor Lockheed Martin website \u00a0and at the USDOD Missile Defense Agency From a Feb. 3, 2017 news report: U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis  warned North Korea on Friday, Feb. 3 of an \u201ceffective and overwhelming\u201d response if Pyongyang chose to use nuclear weapons, as he reassured Seoul of steadfast U.S. support at the end of a two-day visit. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said at South Korea\u2019s defense ministry. \u201cAny attack on the United States, or our allies, will be defeated, and any use of nuclear weapons would be met with a response that would be effective and overwhelming,\u201d North Korea, which regularly threatens to destroy South Korea and its main ally, the United States, conducted more than 20 missile tests last year, as well as two nuclear tests, in defiance of U.N. resolutions and sanctions [and in a challenge to the Obama administration]. The North also appears to have also restarted operation of a reactor at its main Yongbyon nuclear facility that produces plutonium  that can be used for its nuclear weapons program, according to U.S. think tank 38 North. \u201cNorth Korea continues to launch missiles, develop its nuclear weapons program and engage in threatening rhetoric and behavior,\u201d Mattis said. North Korea\u2019s actions have prompted the United States and South Korea to respond by bolstering defenses, including the expected deployment of a U.S. missile defense system, known as Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), in South Korea later this year. The two sides reconfirmed that commitment on Friday. (from a Feb. 7 \u201cWorld Events\u201d posted at StudentNewsDaily ) NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION TREATY: Under the\u00a0United Nation\u2019s (Non Proliferation Treaty),\u00a0countries are not allowed to make nuclear weapons (except for the 5 that had nuclear weapons prior to the treaty \u2013 the NPT U.S., Russia, China, France, the United Kingdom ).\u00a0 Safeguards are used to verify compliance with the Treaty through inspections conducted by the UN\u2019s ( IAEA International Atomic Energy Agency ). NORTH KOREA\u2019S NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM and THE SIX-PARTY TALKS: \u00a0(portions of this information are from wikipedia.org.) The six-party talks were a series of meetings with six participating states \u2013 the U.S., Japan, China, South Korea, North Korea and Russia. These talks were a result of North Korea withdrawing from the U.N.\u2019s Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in 2003. North Korea was led [until his death in 2011] by dictator Kim Jong-Il, who starved and imprisoned millions of his own people. His son Kim Jong-Un became the new dictator upon his father\u2019s death in 2011. The aim of the talks was to find a peaceful resolution to the security concerns raised by the North Korean nuclear weapons program. After five rounds of talks from 2003 to 2007, little\u00a0progress was made. In September 2005, as a result of illegal acts committed by the North Korean government, including the counterfeiting of U.S. money, the U.S. froze North Korea\u2019s overseas bank accounts.\u00a0 The North Korean government then refused to participate in further six-party talks. April 2006, North Korea said they would resume talks only with the U.S. (not six-party), if the U.S. released recently frozen North Korean financial assets held in a bank in Macau.\u00a0 The U.S. did not comply with the request. October 2006 North Korea conducted a test of a nuclear weapon.

Questions Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (from the Washington Examiner and The Daily Caller) \u2013 The Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating approximately 300 refugees in the U.S. for terrorism, a Department of Homeland Security official told reporters Monday. In a background briefing on the president\u2019s new immigration suspension from Sudan, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, and Yemen, one official said 300 cases is \u201ctruly an alarming number,\u201d and added that it is sapping agencies probing the cases. The official added that there are also approximately 1,000 investigations into potential domestic terrorists inspired or motivated by ISIS. Two terrorist attacks by Somali refugees have injured more than 20 Americans in the past year. The DHS also pointed Monday to the case of another Somali refugee who was sentenced to 30 years in prison in 2014 for trying to set off a bomb at a Christmas tree-lighting ceremony in Portland, Ore. The announcement from the DHS official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, came as President Donald Trump signed a new executive order that would temporarily stop refugee admittances for 120 days.  [To emphasize the necessity of] President Trump\u2019s new executive order suspending travelers from the six nations from entering the U.S., the federal law enforcement officials revealed that they are investigating the 300 refugees for terrorist ties. While officials would not provide details on the FBI investigations, they did say that they are refugees \u201cwho either infiltrated with hostile intent or radicalized\u201d since coming into the United States. Apparently some of the refugees have been in the United States for several years, and even become naturalized citizens. Those 300 are part of a larger group of 1,000 refugees who have been the subject of terrorism investigations by the FBI. President Trump\u2019s new order stressed national security as the reason for the order. \u201cThis emphasizes the national security threat,\u201d said a Justice official. The president included two case studies of refugees convicted of terrorism in his newly revised executive order. More than 4,300 refugees have entered the country in the past month since a federal judge blocked Trump\u2019s previous order stopping refugee entry. This new executive order will be effective on March 16, and during the halt in refugee entry, the government will review vetting procedures. Another official said that the six nations were picked not because they are Muslim-majority, but because they are either \u201cfailed states\u201d or \u201cstate sponsors of terrorism.\u201d Compiled from news reports at the Washington Examiner and The Daily Caller published on March 6.

(Photo: UT Arlington) Jump to... Questions Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by Jeremy Agor, UTA News) \u2013 A professor from The University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) has invented a breath monitor that can detect the flu. Perena Gouma , a professor in the Materials Science and Engineering Department, has published an article\u00a0that describes her invention of a hand-held breath monitor that can detect the flu virus. The article, published in January 2017, explains in-depth how the single-exhale sensing device works and the research involved in its creation, which was funded by the National Science Foundation through the Smart Connected Health program. Gouma\u2019s device is similar to the breathalyzers used by police officers when they suspect a driver of being under the influence of alcohol. A patient simply exhales into the device, which uses semiconductor sensors like those in a household carbon monoxide detector. The difference is that these sensors are specific to the gas detected, yet still inexpensive, and can isolate biomarkers  associated with the flu virus and indicate whether or not the patient has the flu. The device could eventually be available in drugstores so that people can be diagnosed earlier and take advantage of medicine used to treat the flu in its earliest stages. This device may help prevent flu epidemics from spreading, protecting both individuals as well as the public health. Gouma and her team relied on existing medical literature to determine the quantities of known biomarkers  present in a person\u2019s breath when afflicted with a particular disease, then applied that knowledge to find a combination of sensors for those biomarkers that is accurate for detecting the flu. For instance, people who suffer from asthma have increased nitric oxide concentration in their breath, and acetone is a known biomarker for diabetes and metabolic processes. When combined with a nitric oxide and an ammonia sensor, Gouma found that the breath monitor may detect the flu virus, possibly as well as tests done in a doctor\u2019s office. \u201cI think that technology like this is going to revolutionize personalized diagnostics. This will allow people to be proactive and catch illnesses early, and the technology can easily be used to detect other diseases, such as Ebola virus disease, simply by changing the sensors,\u201d said Gouma, who also is the lead scientist in the Institute for Predictive Performance Measurement at the UTA Research Institute. \u201cBefore we applied nanotechnology  to create this device, the only way to detect biomarkers  in a person\u2019s breath was through very expensive, highly-technical equipment in a lab, operated by skilled personnel. Now, this technology could be used by ordinary people to quickly and accurately diagnose illness.\u201d Stathis Meletis , chair of the Materials Science and Engineering Department, noted that Gouma\u2019s research shows how UTA\u2019s nanotechnology  research can have a profound impact on health and the human condition in our communities, as outlined in the University\u2019s Strategic Plan 2020:\u00a0Bold Solutions | Global Impact. \u201cDr. Gouma\u2019s development of a portable, single-exhale device that can be used to detect diseases has implications far beyond the laboratory,\u201d Meletis said. \u201cThis shows the impact of nanotechnology on our everyday lives, and has potential for applications related to security and other important areas as well.\u201d In addition to Gouma\u2019s research, UTA engineering faculty have applied nanotechnology to fighting cancer, increasing energy efficiency and detecting harmful substances, among other applications. Gouma joined UTA in 2016 after spending 16 years at SUNY Stony Brook. She earned more than $6 million in research funding from federal and state agencies, such as the National Science Foundation, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Defense. She is a member of the National Academy of Inventors, was a Fulbright Scholar and earned the prestigious Richard M. Fulrath Award from the American Ceramic Society.

On Monday, bomb threats were called into 30 Jewish schools and community centers in at least 18 states, adding to a growing list of anti-Semitic  incidents across the US this year. So far, nobody has been injured. Children evacuating from a Jewish school in Davie, Florida, on February 27, 2017.

No injuries were reported, and the threats came in the form of a series of phone calls Monday morning, then again Monday evening.  [The news comes as the FBI and law enforcement across the country continue to look into the spike in threats against the Jewish community. More than\u00a0100 threats in 33 states have been reported\u00a0since January, and has resulted in students being pulled from schools. Jewish cemeteries have also been subject to vandalism.]. People gather in prayer amid the toppled headstones and damage at Mount Carmel Cemetery in Philadelphia on February 27, 2017.

CBS News first reported\u00a0Monday that law enforcement officials believe the attacks were a coordinated effort. However, a law enforcement official told the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0on Tuesday that [there could also be a possiblity that] a single person may be responsible for the threats.

Questions Background Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by\u00a0Jonathan LaPook, CBS News) December 28, 2016 \u2013 For more than two years, Lance Crowder  was having severe abdominal pain and vomiting, and no local doctor could figure out why. Finally, an emergency room physician in Indianapolis had an idea. \u201cThe first question he asked was if I was taking hot showers to find relief. When he asked me that question, I basically fell into tears because I knew he had an answer,\u201d Crowder said. The answer was . It\u2019s caused by heavy, long-term use of various forms of\u00a0marijuana. For unclear reasons, the nausea and vomiting are relieved by hot showers or baths. cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome, or CHS \u201cThey\u2019ll often present to the emergency department three, four, five different times before we can sort this out,\u201d said Dr. Kennon Heard , an emergency room physician at the University of Colorado Hospital in Aurora, Colorado. \u201cMedical marijuana\u201d dispensary in Ypsilanti, MI, shown July 3, 2013. He co-authored a study \u00a0showing that since 2009, when medical marijuana became widely available, emergency room visits diagnoses for CHS in two Colorado hospitals nearly doubled. In 2012, the state legalized recreational marijuana. \u201cIt is certainly something that, before legalization, we almost never saw,\u201d Heard said. \u201cNow we are seeing it quite frequently.\u201d Outside of Colorado, when patients do end up in an emergency room, the diagnosis is often missed. Partly because doctors don\u2019t know about CHS, and partly because patients don\u2019t want to admit to using a substance that\u2019s illegal. CHS can lead to dehydration and kidney failure, but usually resolves within days of stopping drug use. That\u2019s what happened with Crowder, who has been off all forms of marijuana for seven months. \u201cNow all kinds of ambition has come back. I desire so much more in life and, at 37 years old, it\u2019s a little late to do it, but better now than never,\u201dhe said. CHS has only been recognized for about the past decade, and nobody knows exactly how many people suffer from it. But as more states move towards the legalization of marijuana, emergency room physicians like Dr. Heard are eager to make sure both doctors and patients have CHS on their radar.

Background Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS): Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome\u00a0is characterized by recurrent\u00a0nausea,\u00a0vomiting\u00a0and crampy abdominal pain. These symptoms have been reported to be improved temporarily by taking a hot shower or bath or: More fully by stopping the use of\u00a0cannabis. The syndrome was described by Allen and colleagues (2004), and Sontineni and colleagues (2009) who offer simplified clinical diagnostic criteria. A subsequent, larger study reported a case series of 98 subjects with cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome, confirming the earlier reported findings. The\u00a0long-term and short-term effects of cannabis use\u00a0are associated with behavioural effects leading to a wide variety of effects on the body systems and physiologic states. Acute episodes of cannabinoid hyperemesis typically last for 24\u201348 hours and the problem often resolves with long term stopping of cannabis use. Improvement can take one to three months to occur. Relapses are common, and this is thought to be possibly secondary to a lack of education as many people use or increase their use of cannabis due to their symptoms of nausea and vomiting.

Questions Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by Rachel Lucas, WSLS 10) \u2013 A new survey \u00a0highlights overwhelming misconceptions current U.S. college students have about their student loans, including the fact that they will actually have to pay them back. In a time when Americans are burdened by student loan debt more than ever, it\u2019s an alarming trend that college loan finances are perplexing the next generation. Americans owe nearly $1.3 trillion dollars in student loan debt, spread out among a 44.2 million borrowers. According to Student Loan Hero, the average Class of 2016 gradate has $37,172 dollars in student loan debt. That number is up six-percent from last year. The student loan delinquency rate is 11-percent. According to the survey of 500 college students by LendEDU, a private firm that connects students and their families with student loans and loan refinancing, almost half of those responded that they believe they would be able to receive federal loan forgiveness on their student loans after graduation. Despite the overwhelming misconception, student loan forgiveness takes time, is only open to certain professions and is absolutely not guaranteed. According to the US Department of Education guidelines, student loan borrowers can be forgiven of their debt only if they enter a profession considered to be a public service for a specific period of time. Usually that time period is ten years. Student loan forgiveness is usually available for public teachers who agree to teach in an underserved area. Other reasons for forgiveness include death or permanent disability. Definitely not something students should bank on. In a summary, LendEDU says the survey confirms that college students don\u2019t understand the basic financial aid process. \u201cThe full results of our survey are quite eye-opening,\u201d LendEDU noted. Although the survey shows that 49.8-percent of college students think they qualify for student loan forgiveness, most do not. According to the U.S. Department of Education, those who do qualify will still have to make 120 consecutive payments  before their loans will be forgiven. Not only does the survey show that almost half of college students think they\u2019ll be forgiven, it also indicates that 80-percent of college students could not identify their exact current federal student loan interest rate. That\u2019s like having a credit card, auto or house payment and not knowing the difference between the principal balance and how much interest has accrued. The survey also shows that most college students rely on their parents for student loan information when in fact, it\u2019s quite possible parents don\u2019t fully understand the process either. \u201cIt is concerning that current college students are underestimating the cost of student debt today and tomorrow,\u201d LendEDU noted in the results. The full results of the survey as well as questions answered are listed below. Have you heard of the FAFSA? 90% of college students reported that they had heard of FAFSA. Do you know the deadline to file the FAFSA for the 2017-2018 school year? 84% of college students could not identify the correct filing deadline for the FAFSA. How much does it cost to file the FAFSA for the 2017-2018 school year? 16% of college students did not know how much it costs to file the FAFSA. Filing the FAFSA is free, but unfortunately, 16% of respondents reported a filing cost. Do you know what FAFSA stands for? 78% of college students could not identify what FAFSA stands for. What is included in the Expected Family Contribution (EFC) formula for the 2017-2018 school year? 42% of college students could not identify the components included in the EFC formula. What is included in the Cost of Attendance (COA) formula for the 2017-2018 school year? 75% of college students could not identify the components included in the COA formula. Do you know the difference between subsidized and unsubsidized student loans? 33% of college students could not identify the differences between subsidized and unsubsidized loans. What is the maximum Pell Grant award for the 2016-2017 award year? 80% of college students could not identify the current maximum Pell Grant award for the 2016-2017 award year within a +-15% margin of error. What is the current interest rate on new undergraduate federal subsidized and unsubsidized student loans? 80% of college students could not identify the current interest rates on undergraduate federal subsidized and unsubsidized student loans. Do you know the current repayment term of a federal student loan? 79% of college students could not identify the current repayment term of a federal student loan. Do unsubsidized student loans accumulate interest during deferment? When asked, 44% of college students did not know unsubsidized student loans accumulate interest during deferment. Do subsidized student loans accumulate interest during deferment? When asked, 57% of college students did not know subsidized student loans do not accumulate interest during deferment. Do you know the current federal student loan borrowing limit? 74% of college students could not identify the current federal student loan borrowing limits, relative to their current educational standing. Can Parent PLUS loans be transferred to you (the student) after you graduate from college? 57% of college students did not know that Parent PLUS loans cannot be transferred to the student after graduating college. Do you believe that you will be helped by federal student loan forgiveness programs after graduation? When asked, 49.80% of college students believed they would in fact be helped by federal student loan forgiveness programs after graduation. Is it possible to refinance student loan debt with the federal government? When asked, 64% of college students incorrectly believe that it is possible to refinance student loan debt with the federal government. Reprinted here for educational purposes only.

Background THE STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS: \u201cThe President shall from time to time give to Congress information of the State of the Union and recommend to their Consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.\u201d US Constitution Article II, Section 3 The State of the Union is an annual address presented by the President to the United States Congress. The address not only reports on the condition of the nation but also allows the president to outline his legislative agenda (for which he needs the cooperation of Congress) and his national priorities. By tradition, the President makes this report annually. While not required to deliver a speech, every president since Woodrow Wilson has made the State of the Union report as a speech delivered before a joint session of Congress. Before that time, most presidents delivered the State of the Union as a written report. Since Wilson, the State of the Union is given typically each January before a joint session of the United States Congress and is held in the House of Representatives chamber of the United States Capitol. George Washington gave the first address to a joint session of Congress on January 8, 1790 at the Federal Hall in New York City. Thomas Jefferson, the nation\u2019s third president, did not continue this practice. In 1801, Jefferson detailed his priorities and sent written copies of his message to each house of Congress. Jefferson \u201cwas concerned that the practice of appearing before the representatives of the people was too similar to the British monarch\u2019s ritual of addressing the opening of each new Parliament with a list of policy mandates, rather than \u2018recommendations.\u2019\u201d For the next 112 years, the President\u2019s annual message was written, not spoken. In the 20th Century, the oral address was revived, first with Woodrow Wilson in 1913. Like Washington, he spoke to both Houses of Congress. Ten years later, Calvin Coolidge broadcast his address on radio. The message used to be known as \u201cthe President\u2019s Annual Message to Congress,\u201d until President Franklin D. Roosevelt referred to it as the \u201cAnnual Message to Congress on the State of the Union\u201d in 1934. It began to be informally called the \u201cState of the Union\u201d message or address from 1942 to 1946, and since 1947, it has officially been known as the State of the Union Address. In 1947, Harry Truman, FDR\u2019s vice president \u2013 who succeeded him as President, was the first to broadcast his State of the Union address on television. Since 1966, the State of the Union address has been followed by a response from a member of the opposition party.

Kim Jong-un plans to be equipped with an arsenal of nuclear weapons within the next 12 months, it has been claimed. (The Sun/image Reuters) Jump to... Questions Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by\u00a0Steve Holland, Reuters)\u00a0\u00a0WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0President Donald Trump said on Thursday he wants to ensure the U.S. nuclear arsenal is at the \u201ctop of the pack,\u201d saying the United States has fallen behind in its weapons capacity. \u2026 In his first comments about the U.S. nuclear arsenal since taking office on Jan. 20, President Trump was asked about a December tweet in which he said the United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capacity \u201cuntil such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes.\u201d President Trump said in the interview he would like to see a world with no nuclear weapons but expressed concern that the United States has \u201cfallen behind on nuclear weapon capacity.\u201d \u201cI am the first one that would like to see everybody \u2013 nobody have nukes, but we\u2019re never going to fall behind any country even if it\u2019s a friendly country, we\u2019re never going to fall behind on nuclear power. \u201cIt would be wonderful, a dream would be that no country would have nukes, but if countries are going to have nukes, we\u2019re going to be at the top of the pack,\u201d Trump said. Russia has 7,000 warheads and the United States, 6,800, according to the . \u2026 Ploughshares Fund, an anti-nuclear group The new strategic arms limitation treaty , known as , [an agreement President Obama made in 2011] between the United States and Russia requires that by February 5, 2018, both countries must limit their arsenals of strategic nuclear weapons to equal levels for 10 years. [President Obama had pledged in 2009 to pursue the elimination of nuclear weapons (nuclear disarmament) and this was a first step.] New START The treaty permits both countries to have no more than 800 deployed and non-deployed land-based intercontinental and submarine-launched ballistic missile launchers and heavy bombers equipped to carry nuclear weapons, and contains equal limits on other nuclear weapons. \u2026 In the interview, President Trump called New START \u201ca one-sided deal.\u201d \u201cJust another bad deal that the country made, whether it\u2019s START, whether it\u2019s the Iran deal \u2026 We\u2019re going to start making good deals,\u201d he said. The United States is in the midst of a $1 trillion, 30-year modernization of its aging ballistic missile submarines, bombers and land-based missiles. President Trump also [noted] that the Russian deployment of a ground-based cruise missile is in violation of a 1987 treaty that bans land-based American and Russian intermediate-range missiles. \u201cTo me it\u2019s a big deal,\u201d said Trump, who has held out the possibility of [the U.S. establishing friendly ties] with Russia. Asked if he would raise the issue with [Russian President] Putin, President Trump said he would do so \u201cif and when we meet.\u201d He said he had no meetings scheduled as of yet with [Mr.] Putin. Speaking from\u2026the Oval Office, President Trump expressed concern about North Korea\u2019s ballistic missile tests and said accelerating a missile defense system  for U.S. allies Japan and South Korea was among many options available. \u201cThere\u2019s talks of a lot more than that,\u201d Trump said, when asked about the missile defense system. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens. But it\u2019s a very dangerous situation, and China can end it very quickly in my opinion.\u201d \u2026President Trump did not completely rule out possibly meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at some point in the future under certain circumstances but suggested it might be too late. \u201cIt\u2019s very late. We\u2019re very angry at what [Kim Jong Un] has done, and frankly this should have been taken care of during the Obama administration,\u201d he said. According to Japanese news reports, the Japanese government plans to start debate over the deployment of a U.S. missile defense system known as the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, and the land-based Aegis Ashore missile defense system to improve its capability to counter North Korean ballistic missiles. \u2026 Reprinted here for educational purposes only.

We\u2019re very angry at what [Kim Jong Un] has done, and frankly this should have been taken care of during the Obama administration.\u201d Ask a parent, or a grandparent: Do you agree or disagree with the president\u2019s assertion? Please explain your answer. 7. Consider the following observations: In his 2016 interview with DemocracyNow  in which he opposes Donald Trump\u2019s assertions about nuclear weapons, Joseph Cirincione of the Ploughshares Fund, the anti-nuclear group quoted by Reuters said: \u201cThere is nothing inevitable about nuclear proliferation. For the last 40 years, Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives, have had a concerted policy to reduce nuclear weapons in the world. And guess what. It has worked. There are far fewer nuclear weapons in the world now than at the height of the Cold War. We\u2019ve cut the global arsenals by 80 percent. More countries have given up nuclear weapons and nuclear programs over the last 30 years than have tried to acquire them. We\u2019re down to one rogue state, so-called rogue state, North Korea. That\u2019s it. There\u2019s nobody else. So there\u2019s nothing inevitable about this.\u201d In his commentary \u201c The Disarmament Delusion \u201d Professor Thomas Sowell (currently Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University) wrote: \u201cEven if every nuclear weapon on the planet were destroyed \u2014 and how could we be sure that had happened? \u2014 it still wouldn\u2019t destroy the knowledge of how to make nuclear weapons. Countries with aggressive intentions need only choose the time when they would put their knowledge of nuclear weapons to use, and have the world at their mercy.\u201d In his 2016 commentary \u201c Trump Said the U.S. Should Expand Nuclear Weapons. He\u2019s Right. \u201d Matthew Kroenig, Associate Professor of Government at Georgetown University wrote: \u201cU.S. nuclear strategy cannot be static, but must take into account the nuclear strategy and capabilities of its adversaries. America needs to bolster its deterrence not to start a war, but to prevent one. \u00a0The United States needs a robust nuclear force, therefore, not because anyone wants to fight a nuclear war, but rather, the opposite: to deter potential adversaries from attacking or coercing the United States and its allies with nuclear weapons of their own.\u201d Progressives generally believe in reducing/eliminating nuclear arms worldwide as the best way to protect the world from nuclear war. Conservatives hold the view of President Trump and Thomas Sowell. Nuclear disarmament refers to both the act of reducing or eliminating nuclear weapons and to the end state of a nuclear-free world, in which nuclear weapons are completely eliminated. Do you think this, or President Trump\u2019s plan, is the better U.S. policy? Free Answers \u2014 Sign-up here  to receive a daily email with answers.

President Obama's budget proposal was submitted to Congress on February 9, 2016.  President Trump is planning for FY 2018, which begins October 1, 2017 and ends September 30, 2018.] Jump to... Questions Resources Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (by Kevin Liptak, CNN) WASHINGTON, D.C. \u2014 President Donald Trump previewed a budget plan Wednesday he said would be focused intently on slashing spending in a bid to reduce the national debt. It\u2019s one of three major legislative proposals  the White House is preparing ahead of Trump\u2019s address to lawmakers  next week on February 28, his first speech to a joint session of Congress as President. [In addition to the budget, President Trump is expected to address health care and tax reform.] Trump said Wednesday that plans were nearly final for a health care measure that would replace the Affordable Care Act, and for the tax reform package that he promised on the campaign trail. The White House said Trump was aiming to release his budget blueprint by mid-March, though officials acknowledged the document would amount to only a framework, and not a full plan, since key members of the White House team have just begun work [because Congress took so long to confirm them]. Mick Mulvaney, Trump\u2019s budget director [OMB], was only confirmed last week. [The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is the largest office within the Executive Office of the President. OMB\u2019s most prominent function is to produce the President\u2019s Budget. Trump\u2019s OMB director Mulvaney was confirmed by Congress on Feb. 16; President Obama\u2019s first OMB director was confirmed by Congress on January 20, 2009, the day Obama was inaugurated. In January 2009, Democrats held the majority in both houses of Congress; in January 2017, Republicans hold the majority in both houses of Congress.] Speaking ahead of his meeting Wednesday, Trump promised a plan that would allocate  taxpayer dollars carefully, with an eye toward reducing wasteful spending. \u201cI want the American people to know that our budget will reflect their priorities. We\u2019ll be directing all of our departments and agencies to protect every last American and every last tax dollar. No more wasted money,\u201d Trump said at his meeting, which took place at the White House. \u2026 \u201cWe\u2019re going to be spending the money in a very, very careful manner,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cOur moral duty to the taxpayer requires us to make our government leaner and more accountable. We must do a lot more with less. And we must stop the improper payments and the abuses, negotiate better prices and look for every last dollar of savings.\u201d \u2026 The White House has already identified certain government programs that could come under the knife in the budget proposal. People familiar with the budget plan confirmed reports that a series of federal programs were being considered for major cuts in Trump\u2019s budget. The affected organizations include the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities. At the same time, Trump has vowed to [cut taxes and] increase military spending. Vice President Mike Pence repeated that promise [on the military] in Europe over the weekend on his first trip abroad since taking office. \u201cAs we speak, the United States is developing plans for significant increases to ensure that the strongest military in the world is stronger still,\u201d Pence said during remarks at the Munich Security Conference. A president\u2019s budget typically acts as a statement of White House priorities rather than an actual legislative vehicle. Members of Congress are responsible for drafting and passing a federal budget plan, though with Republicans in control of both chambers of Congress, this year\u2019s plan is more likely to reflect White House thinking\u2026. Whatever plan does emerge will face stiff Democratic resistance, particularly if it contains the type of deep cuts to domestic programs that have been promised. Increasing military spending will require Congress to eliminate mandatory spending caps that were put in place in 2011 under Obama; Democrats are likely to insist that similar caps on domestic spending also be lifted. Speaking Wednesday, [the President said] \u2026 \u201cWe have enormous work to do as the national debt doubled over the last eight years. Our debt has doubled over a short period of time.\u201d \u2026 Reprinted here for educational purposes only. May not be reproduced on other websites without permission from CNN.

Jump to... Questions Background Print Entire Page Just Article Just Questions (Reuters) \u2013 The owner of the SAT college-entrance exam, which has been plagued by a raft of cheating incidents overseas, outlined new security measures but stopped short of remedying the test\u2019s biggest vulnerability. The New York-based said the steps include reducing the number of times the test is given outside the United States and increasing the auditing of test centers. But the not-for-profit organization did not say it would end its practice of reusing test forms overseas that were initially given in the United States \u2013 the source of many of its security lapses in recent years. College Board As Reuters reported last year, the College Board has failed to stop a widespread and known security problem. Asian test-preparation companies are gathering questions and reading passages from past SAT exams, and then giving their clients that material to practice upon. The questions later show up on SAT exams administered overseas, giving an unfair advantage to students who have seen them. The news agency also found that the College Board knowingly had administered some exams overseas that it knew had leaked.\u00a0( Read Reuters\u2019 full \u00a0coverage of the cheating epidemic here ) The problems caused by recycling tests overseas recurred as recently as last month. In its announcement, the College Board disclosed it was cancelling the scores of an undisclosed number of students who took the SAT overseas in January and was reviewing the scores of an additional group of students \u201cas part of ongoing comprehensive investigations.\u201d Reuters reported last week that parts of the January exam given in Asia originally had been administered last June in the United States. The June test was widely available in China and had been sold to students in South Korea. Reuters obtained more than 200 pages of scans and photographs of the leaked exam. Zach Goldberg, a College Board spokesman , declined to say how many students had their scores canceled or in which countries they took the test. The College Board\u2019s chief executive, David Coleman , said at a conference last September that the organization planned to scale back its reuse of tests. Goldberg declined to say today whether the College Board will halt the practice overseas. The College Board said starting this fall, it will cut the number of test administrations overseas from six a year to four. The SAT will only be offered in October, December, March and May. This June\u2019s international test sitting will be canceled. The College Board previously had reduced SAT administrations from six to four in South Korea, Egypt and Saudi Arabia after determining in 2013 that tests had leaked there. But at the time it decided not to take similar action in China, even though it knew that a Chinese website had \u201ccompromised\u201d four SAT exams, according to an internal College Board PowerPoint presentation seen by Reuters. A spate of cheating incidents in China and other countries ensued. The College Board said its new security measures include providing law enforcement and other government agencies with the names of test prep companies and individuals suspected of stealing test materials. It promised to make it easier for students and teachers to anonymously report suspected cases of cheating. The organization also said it plans to prohibit individuals from taking future tests, including the SAT and Advanced Placement Exams, \u201cwhen we conclude they have gained or attempted to gain or share an unfair advantage on any College Board test.\u201d (Additional reporting by Alexandra Harney in Shanghai.)

Background The College Board and the SAT: The\u00a0SAT\u00a0is a fee-based standardized test for\u00a0college admissions\u00a0in the United States first administered in 1926.\u00a0The SAT is administered by College Board in the United States and is developed, published, and scored by the\u00a0Educational Testing Service\u00a0(ETS). Most students take the test during their junior or senior year of high school. College Board is an American not-for-profit organization that was formed in December 1899 as the College Entrance Examination Board (CEEB) to expand access to higher education. While College Board is not an association of colleges, it runs a membership association of institutions, including over 6,000 schools, colleges, universities and other educational organizations. College Board develops and administers standardized tests and curricula used by K\u201312 and post-secondary education institutions to promote college-readiness and as part of the college admissions process. College Board is headquartered in New York City. David Coleman has been the president of College Board since October 2012. In addition to managing assessments for which it charges fees, College Board provides resources, tools, and services to students, parents, colleges and universities in the areas of college planning, recruitment and admissions, financial aid, and retention. College Board is partly funded by grants from various foundations.
