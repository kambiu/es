WPP Chief Executive Martin Sorrell Photo:                        Reuters By Lara O\u2019Reilly Lara O\u2019Reilly The Wall Street Journal Biography Lara O\u2019Reilly @larakiara lara.oreilly@wsj.com Oct. 31, 2017 8:03 a.m. ET 0 COMMENTS Good morning and Happy Halloween. It\u2019s that time of year when marketing departments get ghoulishly creative, although most of the efforts are more fun than freaky this time around, from a classic caught-on-camera prank video from Natural Light to Svedka Vodka\u2019s spooky take on banner ads that follow you around the web. Adweek has the rundown on all the best of the themed campaigns . One for Sorrell, Two for Joy WPP revised down its guidance again for full-year organic net sales and its profit margin , the Wall Street Journal reported. There are a number of factors at play, affecting the entire agency sector. Clients\u2014particularly zero-based budgeters and consumer-packaged goods companies that are being forced to keep down costs by activist investors\u2014are squeezing agencies on fees. As digital ad spending surpasses TV, some brands are wresting back control from their agencies and bringing some of their digital tasks in-house . Then there\u2019s the threat of newer entrants, such as consultants and specialist independents. \u2014Turnaround, Bright Eyes\u2014 None of these trends are showing signs of going away anytime soon, so what does WPP have planned to turnaround its recent bad run? WPP has a four-pronged approach, although we\u2019ve heard these before: horizontality, fast-growth markets, digital and data. On the call, WPP CEO Martin Sorrell attempted to brush off the idea that Google and Facebook or consultants were eating his company\u2019s lunch. Google and Facebook have a large focus on the so-called \u201clong tail\u201d of smaller businesses that don\u2019t tend to use agencies anyway, Mr. Sorrell explained. On the second point, the bigger threat might not be consultancy firms winning against agencies in big pitches (the presentation dismissed figures from Ad Age , which suggest consultancy firms have larger digital revenues than agencies as \u201cfake news\u201d) but more that some consultants are convincing clients to cut traditional agency costs. Mr. Sorrell\u2019s counter to this is that when companies stop investing in marketing, their volume growth falls, so \u201cthe chickens will come home to roost.\u201d \u2014Bonus Chart\u2014 Check out this interesting table  from the earnings presentation that shows how WPP\u2019s spending with media owners has changed since 2012. Back then, Facebook was ranked at just no. 28; now it\u2019s WPP\u2019s third-biggest media investment on behalf of its clients. Let the Games Begin NBC is expecting a bumper start to 2018, when the network will air both the Super Bowl and the Winter Olympics. On Monday, NBC gave an update on how sales are going so far , as CMO Today reported. The network, which only has Super Bowl rights every three years, is in a position in 2018 to package the Winter Olympics with the big game as both take place very close to each other in February. Dan Lovinger, executive vice president of ad sales and marketing at NBC Sports Group, said he expects about 25% of all ad revenue from the Super Bowl and Olympics to come from advertisers buying spots in both events. Overall, NBC expects to net more than $1 billion in ad sales from the two sporting events. Interestingly, however, it doesn\u2019t look as though NBC has managed to significantly drive the price up of a 30-second spot in the Super Bowl from the roughly $5 million Fox was selling ads for in this year\u2019s game. Is that a product of football fatigue, or are cost-conscious advertisers pushing back on ever-escalating prices? Russia Hour What a difference a few months can make. Originally, Facebook executives were writing off the notion that Russian entities could have used the social media platform to interfere with the 2016 U.S. election as \u201ccrazy.\u201d Now Facebook estimates Russian-backed interference on its platform\u2014posts, ads, and even real-life events listings  around polarizing issues\u2014before and after the election reached an estimated 126 million people , the WSJ reports. To put that in perspective, an estimated 139 million people voted in last year\u2019s election, according to the U.S. Elections Project. Facebook General Counsel Colin Stretch is appearing in front of congressional committees today and tomorrow and, according to prepared remarks, plans to describe how many of the ads and posts the company has seen so far are \u201cdeeply disturbing\u2014seemingly intended to amplify societal divisions and pit groups of people against each other.\u201d Google and Twitter are also scheduled to testify in front of the committees, where senators are likely to press the companies on their opposition to stricter regulation. Best of the rest ABC is reportedly seeking as much as $2.6 million for 30-second commercials airing during the 2018 Oscars, a price increase that shows the power of big-ticket live events.

Photo:                        Bloomberg By Costas Paris Costas Paris The Wall Street Journal Biography Costas Paris @CostasParis costas.paris@wsj.com Oct. 31, 2017 8:00 a.m. ET 11 COMMENTS Container shipping is emerging from a painful six-year slump, but a glut of tonnage that will hit the water over the next two years threatens to derail the nascent recovery. In recent months, Mediterranean Shipping Co. and CMA-CGM SA have each announced orders for 11 mega-vessels. Together, with existing plans by Asian giants like Cosco Shipping Holdings Co. and Evergreen Line, the moves mean dozens of these vessels will be delivered by 2020. The ships\u2014as tall as the Empire State Building if turned upright\u2014can move 20,000 containers each and will sail between Asia and Europe, where operators often undercut each other, pushing rates below break-even levels. \u201cThe gap between supply and demand is closing, but there is still tonnage coming in, so the problem is not going away,\u201d said           Alan Murphy,            chief executive of Copenhagen-based SeaIntel Maritime Analysis. Shipping analyst Alphaliner said shipping demand would have to grow 8% annually for the overhang to be cleared next year. If growth is a more realistic 5%, overcapacity will extend into 2020\u2014as long as there are no new orders on top of what is already on the books. Shipowners say rising demand will absorb the new capacity and those with the biggest and most efficient ships stand to benefit. The big players moved to renew their fleets on the back of low steel prices and cheap financing over the past four years. \u201cWe see solid global growth in the U.S., Europe and China, which is good news for shipping,\u201d said           Soren Skou,            the chief executive of A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S, which operates Maersk Line, the world\u2019s biggest shipping company. \u201cWe also see a turnaround in energy-dependent countries like Brazil and Russia, where economies are no longer contracting.\u201d Falling Freight Cost / Ship glut hits freight rates despite rising demand Source: Braemar ACM Shipbroking Recovery expectations are also reflected by strong volume growth at major ports across the globe. Chinese ports handled an average 10% more cargo in the three months to September and West Coast gateway Long Beach, Calif., handled a record 2.1 million containers over the same period, up 16% on year. Maersk\u2019s Mr. Skou expects capacity growth to be more disciplined over the next decade, with only about six global operators controlling the market while smaller players have minimal impact on freight pricing. The shipping ranks have thinned after a downturn in global trade led to price wars among carriers on major trade lanes and an unprecedented consolidation in which the top 20 container lines narrowed down to 11. The remaining players have formed three global alliances that have allowed them to cut billions in annual costs by coordinating cargo and sailing larger vessels. Drewry Shipping Consultants Ltd. estimates that container lines are set to report a combined $6 billion in operating profit this year. The world\u2019s top 20 operators lost around $5 billion last year. More than 60 megaships are on order, with Cosco, the world\u2019s fourth biggest player, getting 17 next year and Evergreen 11 by 2019. MSC and CMA CGM, the second and third biggest operators, will get their deliveries starting in the second half of 2019. Cosco said this week it will raise $1.9 billion through a private placement at Shanghai Stock Exchange to finance the new ships. Rates have come up strongly since the depths of the crisis in the first quarter of 2016 when they hovered at around $300 per box in the benchmark Asia-Europe loop, compared with $783 now. However, after a strong start this year, rates in the third week of October were down sharply across the board according to Freightos, an online freight marketplace. Asia-Europe rates fell 16% on year, trans-Pacific rates were down 29% and Asia to the U.S. East Coast declined 29%. Ship owners say anything below $1,400 on the Asia-Europe route is unsustainable in the long term. Cargo demand usually falls in the fourth quarter after the summer season peak when Western retailers stock up for the year-end holidays, Mr. Murphy said. He expects an increase in freight rates of up to $500 per box in 2018. \u2014 Paul Page contributed to this article.

The shipping world\u2019s restructuring wave is washing over maritime finance.  Three U.S. private-equity firms have submitted bids to take over troubled German lender HSH Nordbank, the WSJ\u2019s Costas Paris reports, extending restructuring in a banking sector still weighed down by the heavy debt load left from the downturn in global shipping . The Royal Bank of Scotland RBS           struck agreements earlier this year to sell some $600 million in shipping loans as it moved away from the sector. Now, state-owned HSH is rushing to find a buyer after suffering massive losses on shipping debt. Looking to buy in are Apollo Capital Management LLC, Cerberus Capital Management LP and J.C. Flowers & Co. The crunch in the financial arena doesn\u2019t appear to be slowing carrier efforts to add capacity: 0.55% Cosco Shipping Holdings                       plans to raise $1.9 billion through a share offering in Shanghai, with the money intended to back the purchase of 20 container ships Cosco has already ordered. The new iPhones and iPads would replace components made by Apple Inc.          is redesigning its foundation electronic devices to jettison a key supplier. Qualcomm Inc., QCOM           the chip maker locked in a legal fight with Apple, the WSJ\u2019s Dana Mattioli and Tripp Mickle report, -0.05% redrawing the company\u2019s supply chain for critical components that handle communications  between wireless devices and cellular networks. Apple would turn to modem chips from Intel Corp.          and possibly from MediaTek Inc.,          moving away from the world\u2019s biggest supplier of such chips. Qualcomm has supplied Apple for a decade. But the companies have been battling over Apple\u2019s claim that Qualcomm is unfairly blocking competitors and charging exorbitant patent royalties. Apple\u2019s plans aren\u2019t yet set, but the new designs suggest the dispute could spill beyond the courtroom and into the smartphone supply chain and reset a market Qualcomm now dominates with a 50% share. The commodities world is gearing up for electric cars.  The London Metal Exchange plans to launch futures contracts for battery metals as soon as early 2019, the WSJ\u2019s David Hodari reports, a new sign that the race to build a new generation of automobiles is restructuring supply chains from factories to the sourcing of raw materials . The LME will work with battery producers and car makers on contracts for minerals such as cobalt and lithium that are used in batteries that power electric vehicles. Manufacturers are trying to manage risk in the mining of cobalt in particular. The commodity is found in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and analysts including Macquarie say the automobile industry could face \u201csustained and widening shortages\u201d of cobalt as soon as 2020. There are similar forecasts for lithium, and analysts say manufacturers will have to produce batteries that are more efficient, and use less of the minerals, to back projections for electric-vehicle growth. SUPPLY CHAIN STRATEGIES The container ship OOCL Hong Kong. Photo:                        Bloomberg News Automation in manufacturing may soon change the direction and speed of apparel  supply chains. Sportswear supplier Nike Inc.          is talking about moving more of its manufacturing to the Americas, advancing a near-shoring strategy that marks a reversal of sorts of the move to Asia  that made the company a mainstay of globalization. The plan, reported in Quartz, is to work with outsourced manufacturing specialist Flex to bring production closer to Nike\u2019s big North American market, reining back the company\u2019s long supply chains to get goods to consumers faster. Nike is hoping to save on labor costs by using more robotics on assembly lines, expanding a strategy its used at Asia factories. Such automation is growing more common as apparel companies look to cut costs. The longer-term benefit may be that they\u2019ll be able change production more quickly to match shifting consumer tastes. The shop-and-ship holiday season hasn\u2019t even started but the competition is already  on to handle the returns. United Parcel Service Inc.          is rolling out an online returns service for small and medium-size e-commerce businesses, the WSJ\u2019s Sara Castellanos writes, adding to the growing focus on an area widely seen as a barrier to profitable online sales expansion . Retail analysts say nearly a third of online purchases are returned, triple the rate of returns for in-store sales. Many brick-and-mortar stores have focused more on getting holiday shoppers to return online purchases to stores to help trigger more in-store sales and reduce the high costs of dealing with returns. And department store Kohl\u2019s Corp.          struck a deal with Amazon.com Inc.          this year to allow buyers to bring Amazon purchases back to Kohl\u2019s sites. It\u2019s a variation on the multi-channel strategy that store operators say can simplify returns.

Ten years on from hitting its all-time peak on its first day of trading in Shanghai, China\u2019s state oil champion PetroChina has lost some $800 billion in market value. Even in the highly cyclical oil business, that\u2019s a hard number to swallow.

Hobbs @tawnell tawnell.hobbs@wsj.com Oct. 31, 2017 5:30 a.m. ET 98 COMMENTS HOUSTON\u2014This region has cleared enough post-flood debris  from its neighborhoods to fill 700 Olympic-size pools. But two months after Hurricane Harvey swept across Texas , tens of thousands of people are still living in temporary housing  and some schools remain closed. Moody\u2019s                       Analytics estimates that Harvey caused $73.5 billion in economic loss\u2014making it the second-costliest natural disaster in U.S. history after Hurricane Katrina. The estimate includes costs for destruction of property and loss of output due to lost productivity. Most of that damage was sustained in Harris County, Texas, which includes the heavily populated Greater Houston region. While the majority of businesses are back up and running , city and county officials say the recovery from personal loss presents a bigger challenge that could drag on for years. As of mid-October, almost 61,500 people displaced by Harvey were still living in hotel rooms, with costs paid by the Federal Emergency Management Agency . The displaced occupied almost 22,000 rooms across 37 states, mostly in\u00a0Harris County. Red Cross-affiliated shelters housed 530 hurricane victims in Texas last week. \u201cPeoples\u2019 lives have literally been changed. This is nothing that\u2019s going to be over anytime soon,\u201d said Dimetra K. Hamilton, spokeswoman for the Harris County Engineering Department. \u201cThis is the long haul.\u201d Texas employment fell in the wake of the storm , with about 4,400 jobs lost in September, mostly in leisure and hospitality\u2014a 0.4% decline from August, after months of steady growth, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. But the bank expects figures to rebound in October and the hurricane\u2019s effect on 2017 employment growth to be minimal . Costly Catastrophes: The biggest economic losses from natural disasters in the U.S., in billions Source: Moody's Analytics Nationally, economic growth remained strong despite Harvey and the more recent Hurricane Irma in Florida . Gross domestic product expanded at a 3% annual rate in the third quarter, compared with 3.1% annual growth in the second quarter, according to the Commerce Department. The hurricanes likely suppressed business activity such as oil-and-gas extraction in Texas and agricultural production in Florida. But the storms likely boosted other types of activity , such as emergency services and repair efforts . The Commerce Department said \u201cit is not possible to estimate the overall impact of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma on 2017 third-quarter GDP.\u201d Harvey made landfall Aug. 25, bringing high winds and 4 feet of rainfall in some areas, and submerging up to 30% of Harris County. The storm is being blamed for the deaths of 88 people , with five others under review, according to preliminary results from the Texas Department of State Health Services.

Greg Abbott           projects the state will need between $150 billion to $180 billion  in federal aid to recover . FEMA estimates that about $5.07 billion in federal funding has already been provided for Harvey-related expenses such as temporary housing, home repairs or replacements, National Flood Insurance Program payouts , and low-interest loans for businesses, renters and homeowners. City and county officials are also dipping into local funds. Houston projects its out-of-pocket costs will reach about $1 billion. \u201cThe City Council has pretty much already emptied out our emergency reserve fund, which is almost $200 million,\u201d said           Alan Bernstein,            communications director for Houston Mayor           Sylvester Turner. Mr. Turner and Harris County Judge Ed Emmett set up the Hurricane Harvey Relief Fund to help victims of the storm, which has raised about $80 million, Mr. Bernstein said.

Already roughly $25 billion in debt, the National Flood Insurance Program is facing massive new claims following hurricanes Irma and Harvey. WSJ's Shelby Holliday reports. Photo: Getty The final count of homes damaged by Harvey is still unknown, but Harris County officials say more than 136,000 structures in the county flooded. \u201cWe know that thousands of people are not going to be able to return to their homes anytime soon,\u201d said Mr. Bernstein, the mayor\u2019s communications director. \u201cThis is a long-term affliction, there\u2019s no doubt about it.\u201d Houston resident           Frank Inselbuch           was already in the process of having his home raised under a federal program  when Harvey struck, flooding his house with about 4 feet of water. It was the third major flood since 2006 for his one-story, 4,200-square-foot home in the Meyerland area of southwest Houston, close to a bayou prone to flooding. Mr. Inselbuch\u2019s home is now lifted about 5 feet, 8 inches higher, paid for in part by a federal grant of $330,000. In total, the lift and repairs to his home are expected to cost around $780,000. An additional $350,000 will be covered by the National Flood Insurance Program. Mr. Inselbuch, who expects to pay about $100,000 himself, said moving wasn\u2019t an option. \u201cYou can\u2019t just pick up and move; you have a mortgage on this property,\u201d he said as he sat in a makeshift office in his gutted home, devoid of walls and flooring. Southeast Texas school systems also remain in recovery mode . The Houston Independent School District still has six schools closed due to damage. The district estimates that repairs will run to $78 million, but officials expect that to increase. Harmony Public Schools, Texas\u2019 largest charter school network, reopened its 19 Houston-area schools on Sept. 11, after closing them for two weeks due to Harvey destruction. Teachers and staff increased their home visits to check on students during the closures and have continued their visits since reopening the schools. During one check, school officials found           Jessica Villagomez,            25, and her three children living in squalor in temporary housing after being moved from their flooded apartment. Ms. Villagomez was working part time and broke. The school offered her a full-time cafeteria job. \u201cWe had lost everything,\u201d Ms. Villagomez said. \u201cI\u2019m thankful for everybody.\u201d Write to  Tawnell D.
